I grew up in a poor family. My sister just found that she can't afford to go to University. So, to put her through, my dad is going to mortgage the house so he can pay for it. But that leaves none for me to go to University, or collage. 

I can't go to school. I have to move out the day I graduate (I'm graduating this year), but I don't have any money at all. I'm not allowed to get a job during school, and I've been trying to get a job all summer but no one will hire me. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. When I finish high school I'm on out the street. No job, no money, no place to stay. I can't go to collage. What am I supposed to do? I don't want to kill myself, but it seems like the only way out. I'm lost. ",suicide

I’ve deal with mental health struggles for as long as I can remember. My mom told me I had my first anxiety attack at age 3. There’s never really been anything bad happening in my life. It’s always been within me. Which makes it even harder sometimes, because unlike a certain event or situation, you will always be with yourself and your thoughts. I’ve been in therapy since 7th grade (I’m now in 10th), but I definitely could’ve used it sooner. 

I’ve been through many ups and downs in the past 2 years, and I recently came out as transgender (female to male) which has made my life so much more complicated. I lost my friends since childhood, and then another group of friends. I stopped going to traditional public school this year. I’ve self harmed, been clean, and relapsed. I thought I was doing better until a few months after I left outpatient at the start of the summer. 

Everyone says I’ve been making really good progress over the years, but I’ve never been this close to suicide on a daily basis. I can’t deal with my gender identity, I’m constantly doubting wether I’m trans but simultaneously experiencing crippling gender dysphoria. I’m disassociating really hard every day (I’ve experienced disassociation since middle school but never for this long or this intense), I don’t even recognize my face, body, voice, or even the things I say or the way I act. I feel like a shell of the person I last remember being. Even taking a step back to analyze my thinking I can’t even comprehend who’s thoughts they are. I’ve stopped talking to people about the fact that I no longer experience a will to live because no one can do anything about it, it just hurts others and makes me feel more hopeless. I’ve always felt like there’s something else wrong with me that hasn’t been diagnosed, but maybe that’s the hypochondria. Thus far I’ve only been diagnosed with Anxiety, OCD, and Depression. I haven’t self harmed in awhile, but it’s just because I know it doesn’t really help and hurts those around me. 

The only way I can describe it is that I’m a cicada. I have a shell on the outside that I’ve shed a few times, but now I’m stuck in one shell. I no longer exist to the outside world, just the shell of whatever state of being I felt connected to last. I don’t even feel like a person anymore. I have no idea who I am even on the deepest level. I’ve been on autopilot for so long. I’ve tried to get better for so long. I can’t remember a time that I wasn’t mentally struggling. It feels like life will never be different for me, it’s like that’s just how god designed me. 

I’m tired of people telling me “it’ll get better”, “it won’t be like this forever”, “you can keep going”. This is all I’ve ever known. Mental turmoil with short periods of feeling ok. And I can’t see any possible way out. No matter where I go, or where I run, the problem is in my head. I can’t escape it. I can only distract from it for a short amount of time. I can’t even remember to eat sometimes now. I forget to do the most basic things. I can never make decisions, so I’m probably not gonna kill myself anyway. It’s too much to plan and I know I’ll probably forget something important. It’s permanent and drastic, and I don’t do well with making permanent drastic decisions. 

I’m just hoping someone will finally say something that clicks for more than a few days, or I’ll suddenly realize something, or I’ll find something that lets me see the light at the end of the tunnel. Feel free to ask questions, even if they’re personal. I’m desperate.",suicide

I made countless errors and coming out of the test and hearing the answers my friends got in the test, I feel like such a complete dumbass.

It really put me in a really bad and unmotivated mood for the whole day. I this legit fear of being looked at as stupid when I know I am not.

So old feelings are resurfacing again and I think I’m gonna ask Sophie out soon, because something has to be right for me to fall back in love with her after one conversation right?

The main reason I’ve been losing feelings for Em is that she’s just been dry, leaving me on delivered for upwards of 6 hours, been distant and just seems uninterested. As far as I know she’s okay, but I dunno if shes worth all the effort I’ve been giving.

1658,"I can't speak.Ever since I was a child, I've had a stutter. Not a mild one, think of the Kings Speech; that one hits closer to home.

I spent my school life listening to everyone chat, laugh, sing, whisper, but could never do it myself. I would sit in the classroom, at my allocated spot at the table hearing questions being thrown out to the room which I knew the answer to; and beyond all other wanting in that moment, all I craved was to raise my hand and answer it like a normal school boy would.

I just couldn't.

Instead I would sit there within my impenetrable silent bubble I'd found myself in, and daydream of a future where I would become an adult and have a happy life, my stutter non-existent. 

Ten years later I'm an adult with a medicore job, with some great friends of whom I'm very lucky to have. My family, friends, and colleagues all know of my affliction, but as they do not have one themselves, all they see is someone with a mundane speech impediment who needs a little longer to ""get his words out"". 

They, and I assume most people who can speak fluently and articulatory without hindrance don't understand or realise the mental and emotional turmoil it can create.  In this day and age everything is based around communication. Want to apply for a job? Sit down for an hour in front of two people and answer questions on you why you want to spend your free precious time filling up the cheeses on aisle six for pennies.  Need cancel a subscribion? Buy a house? doctors appointment? Give them a ring only to have them hang up when they think that nobody is there because you can't say a simple ""Hello"". 

Or perhaps you want to go to the shops to buy a new coffee machine, when the nice lady walks up to you and asks you if you need any help today, completely unaware of the battle which is raging deep down inside of you. Struggling to breathe, facial contortions, colour shifting from milky white to beetroot red. Being so aware of every millisecond that passes, and just before the words come out finally, you realise that she is looking at you funny, with a hint of fear.

It's degrading. Humiliating. Demasculating. Knowing that I am of sound mind just trying to get by with life, but whenever I need to speak to someone, they think something is wrong in my head and avoid me. I go from the friendly looking chap standing by the toasters to someone they regret walking over to because I ""am not acting normal"". And worse of all? The hardest thing for me to say is ""stutter"". So I can't even tell people what's going on so they never realise.

Every waking hour of my life is dedicated to my stutter. It's always there looming behind every choice I make. It's an invisible disease, eating away at confidence from the inside out until a shallow husk remains; filled only with anxiety with lost dreams and opportunities. If this is to be my life, then it is not worth living. Watching peers around you progress and move up to a better life, when I can't even make a phone call without being hung up on.

Suicide has always been in a different reality to me. Seemed too far away or unrealistic to see it properly. However as time goes on I can only see a very bleak future for me in this life.

1661,"I tried to kill myself the other nightI don't really know how to talk about this. Right now my kids are playing and being cute and the conflict of disgust for myself at my attempt to leave them and the disgust that they deserve someone better than their shit mommy is mingled up. 

I feel sick because I haven't eaten again too. But it doesn't make a difference, I'm still fat. I'm not losing weight. 

My attempt was as pathetic and stupid as I am. I tried to run outside naked in 4 degree snowy weather and throw myself into water. I didn't even make it outside. My husband wrestled me to the ground first while I was screaming like a banshee. The bruises are a reminder of how pathetic I am. 

I've been married for six years. I've been in a poly relationship with my boyfriend for four. Ex boyfriend. Yeah, look at the drama queen having a breakdown over her worthless ex. 

My husband is an INTJ. He loves me deeply but he's terrible at showing it. He's very neurotic. (read the wikipedia article for Neuroticism and you've got his biography). He's also the male equivalent of a nymphomaniac. His upbringing was conservative-Christian-style abusive, and he reacts in a volatile manner to almost everything. I'm ESFJ, I try to keep everyone happy, but I guess I'm shit at it. I rarely clean because I'm always tired. Keeping him calm when the kids lose it is a strain. Keeping myself calm when the kids lose it is a strain. Some days I just can't anymore. Those are the days we fight. 

He loves me, he works very hard for our family. I just feel very lonely and not understood. Or that he even tries to understand. He just wants the fight to stop, but also to ""win"" it. To explain to me with anger-skewed logic how I'm wrong nomatter what, in the heat of a fight. When not in a fight, he still doesn't know how to do things make me happy even though we've been married for six years. Even though I know how to make him happy. I've tried to tell him sweet things to try, he'll do it for a day or two then forget. I feel so lonely. 

At some point I'd started cutting, but rarely. Maybe once every few months, then a year or two between. 

Four years ago my husband had had a girlfriend on Second Life for awhile and I'd been ok with it, our marriage had been rocky and it kept him from harassing me for sex so much. He had encouraged me to talk to guys there too. I met my boyfriend by roleplaying on Second Life, and the connection was instantaneous and intense. We talked for hours and hours and hours the first few days. He understood me, the way he thought made sense. We had the same interests, liked the same games, liked the same themes. My husband was jealous that we had so much in common, but he was getting a lot more sex so he didn't complain much. 

My boyfriend was my social life. I told him everything, though I told him too much so many times its probably what killed it at some point or another. We moved around a lot, so I wasn't able to meet up with him until the very end of those four years. Well after he was already over me, though he always said that he loved me. 

We kept moving, then I got pregnant. He was sure I'd disappear, but I didn't. 

No one would hire me pregnant. I became a stay at home mother before I even had the baby. Childcare would cost the same as me working my ass off at part time jobs just to pay for someone else to raise my children for me. 

My husband hurried and got a job in NYC and we moved to a shitty part of NJ when I was 8 months pregnant. The birth was traumatic for me, the doctors were horrible to me and bullied me into a cesarean I probably didn't need. The new baby was colicky and miserable. My husband's job was hell, the commute was hell. I was alone all day with a miserable baby and my online boyfriend. Then the job cut everyone's already spectacularly low pay down by 25%. We lost our apartment. I had to move in with his control freak hyper conservative christian mother. (borderline fundamentalist) My husband had to move in with a friend for a longer commute, for shit pay, while the new boss they assigned when the old one quit screamed at his three person department in front of the entire office. He had sleep apnea and wasn't sleeping. He was in hell. 

His mother is a hoarder. I was crammed in a tiny basement filled to the ceiling with bullshit and an extreme mold problem that made everyone sick. I had my tiny miserable colicky baby down there while failing at breastfeeding and was in pumping hell. He would cry all night and refuse to eat and I had to be chained to a breast pump. I was supposed to be illustrating a children's book I hated. I eventually finished it but it took months and I still don't like looking at it. Talking to Seth was hell. I needed help and relief and so did he and we had none to give. We would be snappy and miserable at each other. So I stopped talking to him. My boyfriend was the only thing that got me through it. I talked to him a ridiculous amount. I was nocturnal to avoid a large portion of everyone's unending stress, and talked to him while I tried to work. He loved me then, dearly. He got so much attention and we would spend hours and hours talking and roleplaying and just being together. It was unrealistic. 

Then my husband would make the hour long commute to our apartment from work on fridays, then the three hour commute to his parents to get there around 11pm. He would be tired and angry and snappy. He didn't want to look at the baby. We would almost always fight. He was miserable and I was miserable and he was jealous. He didn't have his girlfriend anymore. It was the ugliest time in our relationship. It was the ugliest time in my life, except for now I think. 

Eventually he quit the hell job and we immediately moved in with my parents because living with his was hell on earth. My boyfriend didn't manage well. Suddenly that constant attention was pulled. I couldn't be on calls much at all. I had less childcare and I was severely depressed. My husband jealously tried to keep me away from the computer too, after I had abandoned him for my boyfriend those six months. It was rocky. For awhile my boyfriend railed against it, fought to have me back like we were before. Even if my husband hadn't be jealous, that could never happen. Not without leaving my husband, and through it all I didn't want to. I still loved him. He couldn't ask me to, but I know my boyfriend wished I would. Its a natural selfish thing we all do. I'd been unfair and told him things I shouldn't have, told him when I was hurt and when I was angry with my husband. It wasn't business to share. I'd planted strife between them. 

I'd always held this naive belief that my boyfriend would love me forever. He'd pulled away, gotten a lot more quiet. He didn't respond to everything I said anymore, instead I'd be writing pages to myself. That was around two years in. My husband got a job a new job in Pittsburgh. We moved for the fifth time in the 2.5 years I'd known my boyfriend. We got an apartment. I wanted to fly him up but money was tight from all the moving and we were behind on everything. Also having a 1.5 yr old toddler was tough, and my relationship was still strained with my husband. My boyfriend was around probably out of the same lonliness I was suffering from. We were making plans to meet. 

Then I found out I was pregnant again. A failed IUD that had been put in incorrectly. Who knows if I'd been unprotected for a year or if it had moved somehow, I'll never know. It was dangerous. They tried to get me to abort immediately just to be safe but I refused. I had to be monitored for a month to make sure I wasn't in danger of ectopic pregnancy. Once I was out of danger my boyfriend became cynical and distant. He was sneaking around on Second Life with random people, e-clubs. He still played games with me, and playing some Warhammer roleplaying games with him and friends revived it a bit. I tried to fly him up but became violently ill with morning sickness and he cancelled the flight when I said I couldn't do it. I'm pretty sure that was the moment it was really over. 

The pregnancy was miserable. My husband doesn't do well with small children at all. Baby cries make him panic and respond unreasonably, and he constantly talked about how awful it would be to have a baby and a toddler together. Even though I talked throughout the day every single day, my boyfriend was also distant and uncaring. He'd offhandedly mentioned meeting a girl but her husband had been so jealous it only lasted a couple of days.

I wasn't carrying a baby it seemed, I was carrying a nuclear bomb. It was a long, lonely, miserable pregnancy. I cried so much. When the baby finally came I had to have another cesarean, this time because I'd been sitting in a shitty broken chair for years that screwed up the alignment of my pelvis. It was my fault. 

You can't have a trip with a new baby. You can't have your boyfriend up when your body is shitty and you're breastfeeding. While family is constantly in and out. While my life was hell. At least I'd thought so. I should've just let him in. I'm practical to a fault, but I don't think he was even that interested at that point. We still talked every day. We played games together. I tried to make it through my lonely stressful life. I held onto him, and he was sort of there, but I railed against the distance that was so plain. 

Finally, we made plans. The baby was finally old enough to stay away for a few days. We would get together at Anthrocon in Pittsburgh where we live. My husband's girlfriend would come up to meet him too, a girl he wasn't much into anymore either, but wanted to give a chance. Just weeks before the trip, my boyfriend had a heart attack.

It was the true end, because when he wrote about it on his FA, and that girl from before attached herself to him. He began talking to her constantly, more than me. Roleplaying with her, doing all the things he did with me when our relationship had been new. She was married too. She just didn't have children. 

He talked to her for months. She began posting pictures of their characters fucking. She told me to my e-face that ""it wasn't like that"" and she ""respected my relationship"", meanwhile she wrote all over her tumblr about her new ""boyfriend."" 

I'd postponed the trip to October for him to heal. It was for two weeks. It was pleasant but he was distant, and had issues making love to me. He spent a lot of time on his phone. The second week my husband's girlfriend came up, and there was trick or treat and I took the kids to zoo boo and a hallow/birthday party for my boyfriend and a friend of mine. It was chaotic and my husband had a breakdown because he didn't know how to deal with the jealousy but felt too guilty to leave his girlfriend for long enough to get comfort for me. We had a fight where we had to talk it out. It was awkward. 

The rest of the trip was ok but, the second week was stressful and messy. I'd made a bad choice in timing and by adding the girlfriend. It was too much. 

At Christmas I found out that they were together. She posted pictures of her and her husband and him all nude in their furry forms cuddling together. I got very upset. Then I got dumped. I cried, I was told at first that I had been chosen. The pictures came down. We got each other Christmas gifts. 

Then they all reappeared. And he chose her. I spiraled. It was the worst Christmas of my life. I spent hours on the phone with him. The first few times were sweet and caring. Eventually he couldn't keep the facade up anymore. 

He plastered her on his profile immediately. 

I cut myself. Five stripes to numb the drowning feeling. At some point before then I'd figured out that a clean razor stored in a sterile bottle would cut cleanly enough to give me a dose of adrenaline that would numb an episode of drowning. It wouldn't make me feel good, but it would get my head above water until I just existed in a cold, lonely world instead of drowning in a chaotic whirlpool of hurt. 

I took a break from the computer. Stopped taking commissions and withdrew to try to get through the holiday. I bought a bunch of games on steam and spent a lot of time playing them with my husband. He was happy to ""have me back"" and since I wasn't outwardly being miserable he assumed I was all better. 

A month of back and fourth with my boyfriend, still trying to play games together but his platitudes wearing thin and his promises falling through again and again. Then she posts about how he had visited her. In November. Immediately after seeing me. 

I'd been cheated on in the flesh. 

I found out about a week and a half ago. I called him. I cried a little, but I was mostly numb. He didn't sound very sorry about it. I told him if he wanted me around he would have to talk to me. He said he would. He barely tried. 

I cut again. Four stripes to breathe. 

Then a few days later he leaves to go see her. He's at her house right now. Fucking her. I was stupid, I kept looking at his profile on FA. As long as things weren't being posted maybe it was going badly. Then the flood of blissfully happy images appeared. He knew I was following him, so even if I hadn't been checking, they all flooded my feed. I doubt I even crossed his mind when he did it.

Imagine if someone got a divorce, then a month later when his ex found out she'd been cheated on he starts plastering his facebook with images of him and his new gf together. 

It was the final blow. I've never felt so ugly, so fat, so useless in my life, or so alone. My artwork is constantly surpassed by others and its my own fault for not spending more time on it. The time I do spend is away from my children. My house is a shitpile because I don't clean. 

When he posted all that I went upstairs upset and sad. I was angry and tired. I told him what happened and he scolded me for looking at his profile. I snapped. I told him to say loving words or to shut the fuck up. He didn't like it, he kept shoving his advice down my throat and I got more and more hysterical. I ran downstairs. I've threatened suicide so many times in my hysteria during our echo-chamber fights, he didn't even follow. Then I slammed the silverware drawer and he angrily yelled down at me and ran downstairs. I told him to fuck off. He tore into me verbally, I tore back. We worked each other up until I was done. I was betrayed and heartfucked by one asshole and would be spending a life with the other who would never ever be able to lick my wounds, to actually care. Just fucking correct until I gave in. 

I ran for the door. I was naked. I tried to get it open but he stopped me. I ran for the other. He stopped me again. I ran a third time and got it halfway open, he overpowered me and wrestled me to the floor while I screamed and screamed. He held me down until I gave up. 

I should've gone to the hospital but I didn't. 

He stayed home the next day to make sure I wouldn't do anything. 

I asked my ex to call me, he said he would then he didn't. 

I'm not worth it. I'm not worth bothering with. I'm not worth figuring out what I need because why bother on a fat waste of air.

I'm so. sad. 

Sorry for the life story. It doesn't really tell that my husband is a good person, that my boyfriend was too... He said so many sweet things... but his actions do a lot to prove how false they were. That my kids are smart and beautiful but extremely stressful.

Some days I don't know how to keep going. The house is getting steadily more disgusting. I'm getting snappy at the kids because I want to do nothing but sleep, but I don't get the option. 

Its too hard.",suicide

She is very introverted and has a very hard time making friends.  She is extremely smart but also very awkward and has very little self confidence.   

I’m trying to help her come out of her shell and get out and meet more people.   It’s just not working.  She stays in her dorm room all day .. she rarely sees her roommate who shacks up with her boyfriend.   

Any suggestions from teenagers out there to help her?  What could a parent say to you that would help?  Anything??

1689,"I'm not suicidal, but I need some help and advice...I really hate living at home with my parents. I'm 21 and without a job because I was convinced by my parents to go to TAFE and get more qualified to go into the industry that I love, but now it has left me over qualified for anything that I apply for and since the tech industry is small in my country... the market is empty. I apply for ANY job and I mean anything, retail, cleaning and janitorial, sales and marketing. Shit I don't even know a thing about just because I want a job so everyone can stop rubbing it in my face and making me the butt of all their jokes even though i'm trying as hard as I can. I'm also told that I can't have an opinion on anything, I tell them that they can save money by shopping at a store we have here called Aldi as apposed to Woolworths and I just literally get told this, verbatim from them ""You can't have an opinion on this subject""... i'm told that I can't give them suggestions because I don't have a family.

i also have some problems with them accepting a phobia I have where I can't leave the house by myself without having a mini panic attack, here is the story of what happened pasted from another thread.
&gt;About 4 years ago, A friend and I were walking home from a coffee shop, We would have been about 16 at the time and I spotted someone that I recognised... It was a person that I had been having dramas with at school and he was running full tilt at me, Luckily for me I was walking past my school at the time and it was open for a play they were putting on. I ran as fast as I can into the school and got a teacher, called my parents to come pick me up.
I should also explain why I was having dramas with this particular person... Myself and his brother(who was in my year) both have hated each other for about 2-3 years before all this happened. One day he stole my phone and I knew where he lives, so we went to his house and got the phone back. I later learned that his mother had sent him to live in another state with his father, because of that and now his brother blames me for it.
Ever since then his brother has hated me and now I have really bad anxiety every time I leave the house. I can't catch the bus home from TAFE because he rides the same bus as me and he gets off after me. We don't live far apart (2 stops) so I get worried that he might get off and hit me. Whenever I talk to my parents about it they just tell me to get over it because ""He probably doesn't care about you anymore"" and call me a pussy and faggot but where I live we have had a recent spat of one punch deaths and it makes me scared to be put in that position where my life could end with one punch and it frightens the hell out of me. So instead of catching the bus straight home (it's not walking distance), I go and see movies and my parents pick me up from the theatre, but they have stopped doing that because it is a minor inconvenience to them. I have told them why I do it, but again they shrug it off.
It's not like I'm depressed though, I would never take my own life and the fear actually is because I don't want to be put in a situation where my life could end, I'm actually a generally happy person... I have some really good friends(Who I haven't told about this because we really don't talk about problems) and I have made some new ones at my TAFE course. I have anxiety and it runs in the family but no-one understands how I feel because mine was caused by something other than just thoughts and it seems like they quite frankly don't care. I don't want to talk it through with him because I don't want to run the risk of reminding him just in case he did forget about me.

So I want to move out but I don't want to live with other people I don't trust. I live off of Centrelink welfare payments while I find a job but it won't be enough for a decent living out of home especially me living in Sydney, one of the most expensive cities in the world.

I don't ever swear around my parents, EVER. I feel it is disrespectful to swear around people but it has driven me today to tell my mum to fuck off and say it multiple times today because of how they make me feel. So that is how serious I feel.

I asked a GP about the anxiety and stuff and she referred me to a psychologist, but it's WAY too expensive and my parents won't help me with the money because they don't give a shit anyway.   

I guess I just want some advice on my current situation and just want to reiterate, I don't have suicidal thoughts, I love life most times. Just when i'm home life drags me down when I'm reminded that i'm useless for wasting my life so far.",suicide

1695,"Don't even care about a throwaway right now...I feel like a 15 year old looking for attention... I feel so stupid.

I don't want to make a ""wall of text"" that everyone seems so hate, even though I am so prone to them. I never shut up about myself, do I?

I have some weird issue, where I get depressed late at night. I can be okay all day and then all of a sudden I'm just down and I don't feel like trying to get out.

I have only cut once. But I've had thoughts of it for years and years. Maybe 5 or 6 years. I actually did a year ago. I was so glad it didn't scar... I fear the scars.

I don't know if I'm the only one who is like this but... I love the way it looks. I fear the scars so sometimes I just scratch myself so I see all the little white lines and feel a bit of pain. Or used to put lipstick on my wrist so it looked like cuts (for about 2 or 3 years before I actually cut, I would do this). Sometimes now I use red sharpie. Most of the time I find a razor or knife and just look at it... telling myself, ""just fucking do it."" But then I fear scars and don't. 

I even want to do it when I'm happy. I just like the way it looks! I want to look down and see it... but not the scars, they have to be fresh. I don't want the scars in case this feeling one day passes, or someone sees...

I think about killing myself. I think I'm just sucking the world of it's resources and giving nothing back. I have no job, little friends, and I almost have no where to live. In 15 days if I can't come up with the money, I will be homeless.

I am only living on my own because my mom is crazy too. I had to leave, even though I knew I couldn't afford it. I lost all my jobs over my depression. Everyone can see it. I lost boyfriends and friends, too.

I have a boyfriend now, he broke up with me once over my depression, and that I was still in love with someone else. I tried to prove to him that I was getting better, and now hide my depression better. Fake smiles are becoming easier. He believes in me again.

As for the other that I love... I wish he was just a bit different. Then we would be okay. But he demands sex and lacks any sympathy or empathy. The only reason I'm not homeless today is because he helped me out... but wasn't nice about it. Just gave it to my roommate, didn't talk to me. 

I wish we could've been just friends. At LEAST.
see: crappy and depressing pop song about lost love - Katy Perry

This is getting long isn't it? Just a couple more points...

Back to I Feel Stupid. I pride myself on being smart but I feel belittled by people almost daily. I don't know how to cook. I can't keep a job. I'm a picky eater. I'm shy. OH am I shy. I have some social anxiety. I sit in the corner alone at parties unless I'm drunk/high. I know what they're all thinking, ""What's wrong with her?"" And that makes me even more anti-social. I fear the people.

""Why don't you help me cook?"" ""Why don't you initiate sex?"" ""Why don't you clean something without someone asking you to?"" ""Why don't you know how to do _____?"" ""Why won't you try this food?"" ""Why can't you make a decision?""
I feel like I curl up into a shell when I hear these things. And then it gets worse... ""Why are you all quiet and depressed now?""

I don't want to be mean to my boyfriend but earlier I clicked a Reddit link that turned out to be a ""screamer"" gif. So I screamed. He was resting in bed, like usual, and he yells, ""What the fuck! Fuck you! What was that for?!"" I laughed about it and said sorry, but he didn't laugh. I tried to make light of the situation but he was just angry at me for screaming. Thus started my late night depression. I was just fine before that.

I just don't like when people are mad at me. I just want to make people happy. That's all I want to do with my life.

Okay so:
**TL;DR** - I like cutting but fear scars, I'm crazy shy and it makes people not like me, I think of suicide but fear death, I constantly feel stupid and inadequate and instead of doing something about it, I usually hide in a shell and become worse.

before i start, let me say, i'm struggling with gender identity as i'm typing this so let's just say i'm young and non-binary, born female.

\--------

when i was born, i had and have multiple sicknesses. none are really visible, and i'm not sure exactly what they are, but i have a very distinct scar on my lower stomach. 

from ages 1-4 i lived with my grandmother, my mom, my dad, and my uncle. my uncle was and is severely depressed, and just started abusing drugs at this point. i don't remember much from this time in my life, but it was mostly happy. he made a video/movie about his life and i was in it. there was alot of violence and i remember that in the film, my mother was being chased by a man with a gun. i've had a fear of my mother being killed ever since then.

from ages 5-9 i moved to a new house with my parents, but i visited my grandmother frequently and her house was kind of like a safe place to me. around age 6 or 7, the same man who chased my mother with a gun in the film (he was a friend of ours) came to our house, drunk, and assaulted both of my parents with either a pistol or a bat (can't remember). my step brother sexually assaulted me multiple times, and my grandmother had to sell her house. my uncle attempted to kill himself by ODing on drugs in our bathtub. some guy my age at the time touched me in places that i wished he didn't.

ages 10-11, i started feeling depressed and thought about self harm. came out to my parents as pansexual by having a breakdown in front of them. i started having frequent visits with a school counselor. another guy my age kept calling me things like ""his sex toy"" or ""slut"" and he'd always tell me about an nsfw dream he had about me, him, and another guy.

age 12 up until now. started cutting, lying to my parents, getting into toxic relationships. was manipulated into being in a relationship with some girl i didn't like. was sent to therapy. drove/hiked through an EF1 tornado, one of my best friends passed away, my step-brother was kicked out of the house and i've only seen him once since then. my boyfriend, who was the only person i trusted at the time, ghosted and cheated on me, my friend calls me every night saying she's going to hurt or kill herself, and i almost committed suicide.",suicide

I was really cheerful and funny, kind of like the class clown, but when I got home I used to cut my thighs and cry all night. That faded away when I was in grade 11. Cause I simpler didn't even have time to be sad. My immigrant father was expecting good grades and I had to deliver.  I studied really hard in my last yr to get into uni. Problem is I picked the wrong thing. I picked architecture, I don't even know why I picked it. the only reason is reputation. I wanted my parents to be able to brag. My brother and sister are going to study medicine when they graduate. And me.. I had no idea and when I told my parents that they told me to shutup and get a grip. For fear of disappointment, I picked something that sounded great, and something that I thought would appeal to me,being the creative type. Boy was I wrong. I hated it. The first week I knew this is not what I wanted to do with my life. But I had another class I liked that made me realise I would enjoy a different course. I thought oh hey no biggie, I can just transfer right? ... wrong. I told my parents that I was thinking of transfrrring and they almost fucking killed me. They said I was quitting. That I was lazy. That I was giving up. I said okay fair enough it's only been half a year I'll give it another go. I ended up failing every single one of my classes in my first year. I was so sad I couldn't sleep. I was always afraid to tell my parents about my depression, so I never got help. It was so bad I would get jitters and I would uncontrollably cry. I wanted to cut again but I didn't even have the energy for that. I could t tell them I'd failed because I'd probably be thrown out of the house.  My dad legit said either study architecture or get out of uni. My parents are middle eastern and so they're very strict. Especially my dad. I get that they want the best for me but yeah. It's tough. So at the end of first year I asked if I could transfer again, they said no. I was put on restriction at uni for failing so much. And I could only do it part time. I pretended I was going to uni on days I didn't have it so my parents wouldn't notice.  I failed one class and passed 3, which weren't architecture subjects but were things related to the course I wanted to be in. Now, I'm at the end of my second year in this stupid course. Wasting money each day with something I don't have the talent for. It eats me up inside knowing I have taken someone who is passionate about this fields place. It kills me. I'm so sad I can't even smile anymore. I get yelled at by everyone all the time. My whole family puts me down everyday not only because I don't smile and I'm pretty mean to people now, but also because I'm overweight. Just last week my mother told me I was everything she hates in a person. Sometimes I cry so much my tears don't even come out anymore. I just want to be loved and supported. I have so much pressure on my shoulders and no one understands how bad I want to end it all. I'm a coward. I'm scared of death yet I pray every day for it to come. I feel like I'm dying slowly. I don't know what to do anymore. Can anyone tell me if it's worth it....",suicide

I have an appointment with my psychologist set up for tonight, the only person who knows about this, but that feels so far away from right now.

&amp;nbsp;

Suicide is weird. Some days I'm overwhelmed with the need to murder myself, other days I just need it to end and want to die. I never realized before that there is a huge difference between wanting your pain to stop by any means, and wanting to murder yourself. It keeps going back and forth and gets all mixed up, I think I'm losing my mind.

&amp;nbsp;

Even typing this feels like trying to walk through a wall of rushing water. I just need it to end. It has to end. I can't hold on any more.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I wrote the stuff below when my mind was more sound. Feels relevant.

&amp;nbsp;

NO ONE KNOWS how awful I'm doing because I can't talk about it without risking my relationships/job/etc. So instead I lie and just say I'm sick, the kind of sick that they understand, and sometimes I even start to believe it. I would way rather be sick, sick is simple. People get that sick people can't do everything healthy people can. I hate not being able to convincingly tell people that I can't handle anything outside of my bedroom today without lying.

&amp;nbsp;

Like, if I have a migraine, I can just say ""sorry I have a migraine :("" and that's it, no questions asked. Don't get me wrong, I've had lots of migraines, and they are awful, I wouldn't wish them on anyone, but I would still take chronic migraines over this any day.

&amp;nbsp;

If I have a migraine, people don't get mad and confused and expect me to explain further, or think I'm up to something or being passive aggressive or snotty. ""I just can't go. Wish I could, but I have a migraine."" Simple as that.

&amp;nbsp;

People feel compassionate and understand your pain when you have migraines. They bring you food and worry about you and hope you feel better soon. I wish there was something I could say that would incite that level of understanding with people when I'm having a bad day because of mental health reasons.

&amp;nbsp;

With this, at best they get uncomfortable and quiet. More likely they get confused and put off and start to distance themselves from you unless you make it up to them somehow. You owe them if you unload this shit on them.

The surgery was to correct an overbite, however she feels her jaw now looks like a man. She’s also having an identity crisis because she just doesn’t look like her. She can’t stand to look at herself and She covered up every mirror in the house. She has guilt that she spent 19000 CAD on something she hates. She regrets the surgery so much. A reversal surgery is an option, however the soft tissues may never go back, she risks losing feeling in her face and it’s not guaranteed to look like “her” again. It will also cost another 9,000 CAD.  

My sister hasn’t been well most of her life, she’s being trying to commit suicide since she was 12 years old. Before this surgery, she was upset with her boyfriend and before that her job and before that school, etc. She’s 30 now. But this go around it’s become so hopeless. She just doesn’t see a way out of her despair. 

She has attempted suicide several times over her face:
1. Tried to jump off a bridge
2. Tried to drown herself
3. Tried to cut herself
4. Ordered helium online to gas herself
5. Bought a hose to attach to her exhaust and feed in through her car window. 
6. Swallowed 100 pills. All of her medications. This one happened today. 

Every time it’s been a miracle she hasn’t died. Every time we bring her to the hospital she is let out within 24 hours. The longest she stayed was a week. It’s really tearing our family apart as none of us know how to handle any of this. I’m so afraid she’s going to die. I live every day in complete fear that any phone call I get is the one where they tell me she’s gone. I’m doing everything I think I can to make her want to live.

So I'm in grad school and it really sucks. I'm really not into the idea of going into academia, but I don't want to quit, I love my discipline and, let's be real, I have nothing else going for me. That said, I can't stand my peers or the faculty, I feel like an idiot most of the time and I cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further, given the cost.
I got into a language program that would be great for my CV, but financially speaking, I just can't afford to support myself through the summer. Outside of loans I'm on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money I have left. I tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if I don't do this, I will not get my degree. My adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning.
I have no clue what to do. I don't want to give up my degree, but I really, really HATE my program. If I stay, I'll be miserable, if I go, I'll hate myself for quitting. I know what your thinking, but transferring in grad school is easier said than done. 
Last night, I got into a really big argument with my parents. It wasn't so much about what decision I was going to make and more about the fact that I need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself. A few hours later, after I got done studying, I was really upset.  I was thinking that I had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it. So, I took my belt off, fastened it around my neck, tied it to a rack in my closet, not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there. I considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head, but either I didn't think it would work or I chickened out. I don't really know which it was. I took it off and just went to bed.
So, I guess my question is, did I just make a suicidal gesture and what should I do about it? I don't want my parents to worry about me/I don't want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation. But, I also don't think  this is something I should brush under the rug.",suicide
1797,"Please just let it be overAlright time to vent because I’ve been bottling shit up for weeks and I have no one that I trust in my life to talk about at least not anymore. If you’re here for coherent thought probably not going to find it here. 

I seriously don’t even know what I’m doing anymore I’ve been scraping through university I actually have more fails then passes at this point and I’m in my second year. Pretty sure I’ve failed every subject this semester and I didn’t need to. But I can’t help myself I’m self-sabotaging I destroy my life every single fucking time I get it back on track…. Every time.  

Finally got a great bunch of friends is that what you called them? I think more of them are acquaintances. The one friend I thought would have my back when shit got rough didn’t well no surprise there so much for equality. If she has a problem I was always there for her to talk to but when I’m spiralling into a dark place is she ever there for me? No of course not why would she be I’m obviously not worth the time so fuck her and her friendship. I’m your close friend when I need support but if you need it I’m not even going to try and talk to you. Seriously fuck friendships I’m so done. 

So I’ll probably fail this course no surprise I don’t really have the personal aptitude for university or this career path but then what sure failing university isn’t the end of the world but I think it should be at least for me. The thought of existence without purpose drives me crazy if I fail what am I supposed to do? Go find some shitty as job so I can pay bills to live a mundane existence alone? Why fucking bother I’d rather just go kill myself and if it comes that point I think I might actually have the balls to pull it off. I’ve always been a coward because there’s always some glimmer of hope but fuck it I don’t care anymore everything I do is pointless. 

I just spent two weeks ignoring the world and now I’ve re-emerged I know every I knew thinks of me differently. They don’t know what it’s like judgemental ass-holes getting everything in life handed to them on a silver platter.

1803,"Most days my brain is just silently AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIt's like this indescribable emotional pain mixed with an intense, almost overwhelming desire for life to end all resulting in a feeling as if there's a corner of my brain just screaming endlessly.

**TL;DR** **Shoutout to everyone here trying to get on with life with a brain that wants to die**

Posting here because I can't act anymore. I can't pretend that everything is okay. I've gained 6kg in a week from eating rubbish which is super yuck, but I also don't care because my brain has been swamped by intense suicidal ideation and if I'm not sufficiently distracted the thoughts about suicide come back in like BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM just drowning out everything else. 

I think about self harming a lot. I mean, not only suicide but other forms of physical pain. But then I remember I've got way too many scars already and additional scars and a high pain tolerance doesn't change anything.

I don't have a good reason to want to die. There's no major crisis. The relationship breakdown was over 4 months ago and I'm mostly over that. I have enough money for everything I essentially need. Sure, I'll probably need several more major operations because genetics suck, and I'll definitely need a double mastectomy at some point because cancer risk,  but that's not it either. It's not even the fact that I have about three friends, and the last time I hung out with a friend was in February - because,  at the moment.people are too exhausting for me to want to have any interaction with. I don't want anything to do with anyone right now. I can't pretend to not be depressed when I'm around other people anymore. It takes all of my energy to pretend to be normal and smile and laugh at work, and I know I don't do a very good job at that as it is. 

It's not really any of that. I just don't care anymore. About any of it. Any of life. I am amazed I have been together enough to do things like shower and brush my teeth and pay bills and work 3 days a week. Do look pale and run down as shit though. Going through the motions, I guess, while my brain is screaming I want to die all the while. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm thinking about suicide all day, every day. I suspect it's the general anaesthetic I had from a colonoscopy in May sending me off the deep end into post-operative depression, but also the general state of the world. 

Now, I know if I stopped eating crap and did more exercise and got more sunshine and made more of an effort to be social I'd probably feel better. But it also gets to a point where you cannot bring yourself to do any of that, because just getting dressed and maintaining basic personal hygiene is a mammoth achievement. So, I am going to my GP on Monday to ask to go back on antidepressants. It might be a complete waste of time and money, as it has been in the past, but I can't help hoping that this time will be different, that this time maybe we'll try a different drug that might actually give me the capacity to overcome the intrusive suicidal thoughts and do the exercise and the things I know I need to do for wellbeing.

Also going to see the psychologist on Monday. It's been difficult to get an appointment (a) because it's bloody expensive and (b) because a huge chunk of the general population are under huge stresses so she's super busy and hard to get into. I'm hoping I have the money to continue to see her because she's the best psychologist I have ever seen. I haven't kept it up because of financial stress, and my mental health has suffered as a result. But I think this time I should be able to stick with it for a while.

It's been hard because the depression has screwed with my cognitive function and sleep again too. I can't concentrate for more than 2 seconds. I'm agitated and drowning in anxiety all the time. I go to sleep late and wake up early whether I like it or not. I can't remember anything and everything takes me ten times longer to process or understand than usual, and I constantly feel as dumb as a rock. 

I wasn't entirely honest with my doctor last time I went because I didn't want to be on antidepressants again, and I sure as hell didn't want to run the risk of being put in a mental hospital again. But at the moment it's gotten to the point where I just don't care about anything anymore, so might as well be totally upfront.

I think I'm too lazy to actually kill myself. Having been there and tried that more than once, getting it right takes a lot of planning and organising and logistics I just don't have the energy for. Especially because were I to go through with one of the plans for suicide I have, I don't want to leave all my stuff just around for my family to deal with. I'd need to sort out my belongings and affairs etc etc etc and make sure I had enough money to cover any potential funeral or medical expenses if I fucked it up.

And that's the nub of it. Human beings are both incredibly resilient and incredibly fragile creatures. I think what keeps me going at times like these is that I know if I failed suicide where I was left half brain dead and still aware, that that would be a fate far worse than this. My life could be 100,000x worse than it currently is, no doubt. But knowing that doesn't change that incessant suicidal impulse blamming it's way across my brain.

I just wanted to put this out there because I needed to tell someone how I feel right now with completely honesty. And maybe someone else will resonate with how I feel right now and it might help them feel they're not alone.",suicide

I struggled with suicidal thoughts throughout my entire college years. I studied medicine in Germany and work as junior cardiologist in a challenging top tier university research hospital here in Germany.

I am getting bullied by my colleagues and mentally tormented. I failed at many research projects and get bullied heavily because of this. I am 26, have no social interactions besides going to work and the gym. I have no friends, never had a girlfriend or any kind of physical contact to the opposite sex. The worst part is my work and all my failed projects. I just do not enjoy life. I know that many people here are in worse and more precarious situations, but I do not want to exist.   
I hate every moment. The only reason why I am living is my family and brother. I do not want them to feel sad when I die.

1825,"""Suicide is selfish"", ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"". Bullshit.I have heard these for years. It drives me fucking insane. I find it amazing people don't see the blatant hypocrisy.

They think it is selfish for someone to kill themselves, and put their family through pain. But somehow, they don't see it as selfish that they expect someone who is suffering to keep living so that their family or friends don't have to suffer through the loss.

Like really, as if it is isn't enough of a shitty deal to be depressed and suicidal, they have to stick you with the guilt of being selfish for wanting to just be done with it all. Unreal. And I'm the selfish one?

Oh, and my other favorite. ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" Yeah, ok. Spoken like someone who has no idea what chronic depression is like. There is nothing temporary about it. It is forever. You might get some brief breaks from it, but it's never gone for good. ",suicide

I don't know why I've kept going until this point, other than the fact that I'm too poor to buy a gun. I dream about it. I fantasize about it. It's the only remaining thing I have to look forward to- my job is a dead end, I'm not going to college, I have no real friends, nothing to make me want to stick around. I'm beyond the point where this is just a quick escape from a bad situation- my life has been shitty and pointless for years now and I'm sick of coasting along just because I can't bring myself to do anything else. I'm unwilling to put the time and effort into spending years in college to maybe change something, or to try and find a new shitty job that pays just as little that amounts to nothing more than a change of scenery, or to find someone to talk to about this to try and hear them explain why my life is a precious thing I shouldn't waste or some shit like that.  I'm just sick of this. There is not a single aspect of my life that appeals to me in any way any longer, and I'm tired of staying in a world I don't want to be part of just because it's expected of me.

1837,"I don't know how to carry on right nowIm 29, living in the UK.

A small background of my health conditions, just to give some context:
- bipolar disorder type 2
- severe anxiety
- obsessive compulsive disorder (which I'll explain a little)
- emotionally unstable personality disorder
- hyper mobility syndrome
- ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)

My diagnoses mean that I really don't and cannot function normally. I did for so long, forcing everything into a bulging box, taping it shut and hiding it under the bed. 

Then I got made redundant from a job that I enjoyed and was good at. Very good at. It was a call centre admittedly, but I really enjoyed it. I made some brilliant friends, including someone that ended up being my best man and I really do consider him a very good friend. Through him, I have met other friends, plus someone who understands the shit that I am going through.

I ended up having to take a job that sucked. A lot. It was the beginning of the opening of that box. It was slowly being pulled out from under the bed. I was treated like shit. I had no sick pay, so when I needed the time off when I was having a bad MH day, I was financially fucked. I was working full time, looking after my wife and we struggled a lot. Not as bad as some, but my god it was hard. The job was complicated and my MH (which we later worked out was my ADHD) just compounded matters greatly.

I ended up getting another job! HUZZAH! It was in insurance which is something that I had done at my old job. Private office. Nice little family run business. Annnnnnnnnnnd that's where we hit the snag. I wasn't very good. I wasn't expecting myself to hit the floor running, but I hit the floor. Hard. 

I wasn't worried though, I thought that I would be at least given training. Which I really wasn't. In anyway. But, I soldiered on for four days, getting up a lot earlier than I normally would have, mental health be damned. The pay was so much better, no shift work and I could get a bus all the way home, meaning that no busy town, no social interactions, just iPod and a quiet journey home. 

Then, four days in, the recruitment agency that contacted me initially called. I was on the bus, leaving town as I had to collect a parcel from one of those amazon thingies, as I live in a flat and my wife's mobility isn't great, and this was a iPhone, so I wanted a secure place for it to go. I updated my facebook status ""New job, new me, new beginnings. Let's do this and let's get life back to what it should be! - feeling positive.""

I got on the bus and my phone rang. It was the recruiter and they had some concerns about my working there. The owner wasn't happy that I was asking questions and that I wasn't as good as they expected. Don't bother going back. My heart stopped, and I just didn't know what to do. I started to cry, but realised as a grown man, I had to hold it together on the bus. I started to catastrophise, terrified I was going to lose my house, my bills weren't going to get paid etc etc. Then there was my wife?! What was I supposed to do?

I got home and tried to be pragmatic, I applied for disability, I couldn't cope with the prospect of looking for a job in anyway as I knew the box had been ripped open and all manners of hell had been unleashed. Pandora had walked off with the proverbial butterfly that signified hope. She had walked off, crushing it in her palm. 

Disability came through and I was ok for a little bit, I ended up in hospital after an attempt, but I was getting better, day by day. I applied for college, am doing ok ish on my course. 

I subsequently got diagnosed with ADHD, and HMS shortly after, and I am struggling, but I am finding that some days I am falling under the water and cannot cope. I am inflicting a lot of this on my wife, being verbally abusive and quite frankly a total c*nt. 

I have been physically abusive to her in the past which I am in NO WAY proud of. If I had my way before, I would not be posting this and someone would have been scraping my remains off the ground floor of a 18 story drop. 

This brings us to now. (sorry if it seems a little patchy, I just wanted to give a little context). My OCD is at the point where I cannot stand waking up, I struggle with even little things not working, just the slightest imperfection in something and it must be rectified there and then. It also has left me having to constantly check that I have everything. Many times. It leads to me being late for things and panicking like a bitch when I cannot find something. My memory tends to feed the compulsions. I skin pick, I cut at spots, scars, anything that I deem unnecessary. 

This was made very apparent to the disability assessor, when I tried to explain things and just couldn't. I was left in such a state after that assessment meeting. I am so grateful for the person I saw for being so caring and understanding. 

I have found that very little keeps me going at the moment. I am trying so hard, but cannot cope. My HMS leads me to sometimes needing a walking stick. It's embarrassing. I want to end everything and just make this constant sensation of failure and hell end. 

I have a wife. I have an aunt with two little boys that think the world of me. I have two best friends again with little ones that do the same. I cannot forgive myself for thinking like this. But equally I cannot cope with the way my brain is working. 

I don't know what the future will hold.

I don't know what to do beyond hiding in my room with my laptop and my iPod trying to simulatenously distract myself from myself and hide myself from everything else.

I’m no closer to success today than I was 20 years ago and I’m not going to spend the rest of my life hoping and praying and visualizing that a life that is tolerable will somehow magically happen to me. It’s become painfully clear that visualization is bullshit. I am so tired of struggling. Always having nothing. I’ve been in debt literally my entire adult life. Even with two bankruptcies I can’t seem to get my shit together. Every time I try something new to dig my way out it goes to hell. Constant repeated failure really is no longer acceptable to me. I will no longer live with debt that cannot be erased regardless of what I do to try - I’m so tired of the overwhelming stress that comes with that - It’s been literally my entire fucking life. I don’t remember a time that I wasn’t in debt and I don’t remember a time that I haven’t been stressed about finances. It seems as though that the universe has decided, without me, that I am not allowed to be successful financially because literally nothing works out for me regardless how much I want it or how hard I try for it.  
About a year ago I had what I would call a spiritual awakening. A realization that we are all connected and that our consciousness is eternal but our time here on earth is only temporary. I believe we choose our lives before we get here and everybody has a mission that is spelled out before we’re born. The bonds we create on earth are actually created long before we’re ever even conceived. We all have a pre-destine mission in life and the universe will push us in a the direction we need to go but we are given free will in order to achieve your life mission. I’ve had a lot of amazing opportunities in my life, many of which I have completely fucked up beyond what I can ever recover from. I’ve done stupid things, said stupid things and I’ve hurt people that I was supposed to walk this life with. It’s unfortunate because I know I could have achieved great things with the right partner and proper support. I just got tired of waiting and too proud to ask for more help at this point. 
Time for a reset. 
Please also know that there is absolutely nothing that anybody close to me could’ve done to prevent this - literally nothing - so you have absolutely no reason to feel bad or have any thought of “I should’ve or could’ve or would’ve” done something had I only known how bad he was. 
I’m so sorry to my family and friends and mostly my nephews. I promise that no matter what I will always look out for all of you from the other side. 
I love you

PS please do NOT have a funeral for me. I don’t want anyones money spent on a ridiculous party to celebrate a failed life. Also, I wouldn’t bother dealing with the CRA or the bankruptcy. You’ll only find insurmountably crushing debt that’s pretty much un-erasable anyway... believe me I’ve tried. I’m so sorry if my passing has caused any financial strain to anybody. I have nothing to offer financially but maybe you can sell some of my belongings to cover any expenses that come up from this.

1887,"I am not sure what I expect out of sharing this.
  Anytime I have reached out in a moment of deep despair to our community through the various subs all the beautiful people rush forward and try to help which I appreciate immensely.  However, even if I am alleviated of the pain of my existential issues, the issues themselves remain.  So I have found myself in a moment with less emotional intensity and may be better equipped to rationally examine this.  I have been VERY careful not to discuss this with most people because I fear disrupting their foundation upon which all the good things rest (ideals, dreams, goals...etc).  If I am to progress past this low point in my life, I absolutely need to approach the issue from all angles here.  I am not great with structuring these things sometimes, so please forgive me.

  Of all the lingering elements from my past that still bother me, the foremost amongst these is my endless source of **self-loathing** and my issues being invested in this world, in this life.  While discovering I was trans finally gave me what I needed for decades, the knowledge of what I am, everyone is aware that 'it can get worse before it gets better'.  I rode most of these waves rather well, I believe, considering all that has to be unpacked, disposed off and the healing that must occur.  But I think these two things I mentioned keep coming back to bother me.  

  How can I stop hating myself (if I even should!)?  I have felt this and fed this since middle school, about twenty years ago.  While life has occasionally distracted me from this omnipresent fact, this is part of the poison that seeps into the well.  I have tried creating positive feedback loops with proper self-talk and productivity, revising my mental narrative and outright ignoring those thoughts and feelings and focusing elsewhere.  I have seen therapists and I am familiar with their tools.  But this is DEEP and implacable.

  Next, as with many of us on this path, I managed to **survive by escaping** this world.  For me that meant graphic novels, standard novels, gaming and eventually substances.  Some people think I am strong, but I only managed to endure by being mindful of putting one foot in front of the other while dreaming of other worlds, of another life.  Now, even when I try, I struggle to engage with this life.  And by that I mean to really feel invested, to DESIRE to work on something and improve something, to have the hope of any success.  I have always felt like I have been a person that just 'was not there'.  

(Warning for others that are older, harsh thoughts for my age ahead)

All of this is exacerbated by getting older.  Its a feeling like waking up from a coma in a house that is literally falling apart around me.  Having to struggle to get my life on track fighting with the momentum it has taken on and maintaining (without any hope of actually improving really) my body and appearance is just devastating.  I was better of not caring at all.  Who is out there for me?  What is there at all at this point?  Acceptance?  Surrender?  Just making it through and surviving?  Those sound like compensation prizes, like an achievement worth little to no value.  I have focused on goals, ran upon the hedonic treadmill, and behind every thought is...**why?**  My moment basking in the warmth of my trans epiphany has faded, and I am left with the harsh reality of picking up whatever pieces I can find and seeing their value.  And for me, I see none.  

I am weak, I am afraid, and I am a burden to my family and friends.  I have broken hearts when I was lost and made so many mistakes.  I just want rest, please....I just want to not be me anymore.  I do not think kind sentiments will do much anymore.

1889,"Difficult thoughtsSo, I'm in one of my crisis and just came across here while trying to find something to get my mind off of everything. So I guess I'll just post away and hopes it helps a bit.  


So, I had a friend. She commited suicide in 2012, and I got to know only in 2013. I was in my last year of high school when I discovered, and I had a fight with her. Stupid reasons, really. Mostly not agreeing on stuff that really wasn't important. When I tried to talk to her again to apologize, or something, I got the news. It was heartbreaking, and I wish I could have done something, anything. I mean, we were both pretty alone at... life really. And just like that, a person that was one of my only friends was gone, just like that. Nothing I could feel other than the pain it left, that I could never talk to her again. That all I have now is fucking memories.  


So, you'd think, due to my experience, that I'd learn something. I don't know. But even all those years later I just did not forgive myself. I'm not particularly alone, and I KNOW there are people that care. That they are with me, and all that. Still, even when people say that I'm worth it or whatever, I can't seem to believe it. All that comes through my mind is how much I fucked everything up for basically nothing, and how nothing I could ever do would revert that. It's so stupid, but yet, every once in a while, it becomes so heavy and I just don't know what to do. I think that I'm not worth it. That it'd be better if everything came to a stop. But yet, I do believe in the words of the few people that say they care, no matter how hollow they seem when I think about it. Basically, yeah, I don't know. Honestly, I just feel like utter shit, and usually I tank this shit alone, as I've always did. And I see where it takes me. I just wait and see, like the stupid coward I am.  


Anyway, I'm sorry about this. I'm not sure it all made sense, but this is how I'm feeling. this is how I usually feel when late night comes around and I can't just so something to make it go away. Anyway, I'm sorry if this bothered anyone. I just needed to let this out in a different place, in a place where I don't have the certainty people will just say that I should ""let it go"" already.

Actually, that's not true. My life is great compared to a lot of people; my family rocks, I have (a decent amount) of money, I'm in college, and good friends.

I have no goals, I’m a Christian without faith and can’t find the point to living anymore. I’m 18 years old and have never felt more tired in my life in Uni as my daily life drains me more and more.And I ask myself every bloody day “what’s the point of being here?” I want to die to begin with but I had to have the typical fear of maiming and surviving.

This isn’t a new question, it’s been haunting me for about 6 years and I don’t know how to get any drive back, nor has my life improved. The coffee doesn’t help nor does the medicine.

I get that people say uni and studying are for the future and they’re necessary skills/trades. But why bother with it when your suicidal, the amount of time I envision myself dying is probably more than I study daily.

I’m just taking a random course to begin with so I don’t even know why I’m even going to uni, probably to just meet expectations.

It’s not that I have no one. I have friends and family that I can rely on and I know it’s a privilege. But I just can’t seem to find the drive to keep on going as the older I get the worse it becomes.

1950,I just lost the woman I lovedMy relationship with this amazing girl ended last night. I loved her and due to having a really really hard past where I have been hurt by parents family friends and women it's hard for me to trust. And I trusted and it's gone. For the first time I've not been happy that I have a girlfriend I was happy I had her. I love her. And it's over and I don't have any close friends. She was my best friend. I feel so alone and so hopeless and for once someone loved that I'm just a dork. For once someone saw something in me. For once I felt like I was actually worth something. For once I trusted. So many women are focused on sex and just don't really care. And she was different. She was everything I've ever wanted and we are over. I have had so much go wrong in my life and so little go right. I just hurt so much,suicide

1954,"Concerned for a friend, our conversation has left me shaken up.I want to start from the beginning, I apologize early on if the information is not needed. I will try to get to our conversation that just happened a few minutes ago quickly. Sorry if the formatting and paragraphing is weird. 


I play online video games quite a lot. This has led me to meet plenty of people who come in and out of my life a lot. Except for one of my friends who we will call James. We have talked and played together for a little over a year now. This has caused a pretty good relationship to grow between us. We text/call each other and even video chat on the occasion. James is 19 and lives in another state than I. 


Because we have grown so close we talk a lot about things that happen in real life and about our pasts. He mentioned to me that he has attempted suicide before, but was saved, and generally during our relationship he was never depressed or has ever shown any signs that he is still feeling like killing himself. 


It all started a about 6 months ago, when he got together with this woman, they dated for a few weeks and he made her pretty happy. He often makes the mistake of falling to quickly and deeply in love. When they broke up he was very depressed, the only time we would ever talk was when he was completely intoxicated. We went through a period where he would never answer calls or texts from me even. Finally, some good things happened in his life that brought him up and we were talking again. 


Just 2 weeks ago, he decided to try dating again. He met a girl via a dating app. They talked non stop, which made him smile and laugh and REALLY made a difference in him that even I could see from a few states away. They met each other in person as she only lived an hour away from him and everything was going great. He was talking about how much he loved her (I don't know if he told her that) and how she could be the one he marries. I didn't want to ruin his fun, as it was nice to see him happy, so I did not say anything to him about how soon it was to make statements like that. 


They broke up yesterday. He had text me very early in the morning when I was sleeping and I didn't get the text for another hours. All it said was ""I need someone right now"". I felt terrible because somehow I knew what happened. I gave him a call, no answer. I text him, no answer, so I called him again and he answered, saying he was at a friends getting drunk. I asked if he was okay, and he explained to me what happened. They broke up because ""her mom told her she didn't want them to be together"". He pretty much hung up on me, so I decided to give him space, as he clearly didn't want to talk about it. 


Today, when I asked him if he wanted to play any games (I didn't want to bug him about what happened). He said he would, so we got on and played for about 20 minutes before he left to go play a different game. After a few hours he called and sounded extremely intoxicated. He asked to play, so I hopped on the game and joined him. I asked him if he was drunk, he said he was. I could tell. 


This is where it gets to our conversation I asked why he was drinking so much, he explained that he has felt like he was having a heart attack all day and yesterday. He was slurring his speech, making incoherent sentences, etc. Then he (very casually) says he wants to ""blow his brains out"". It took me by surprise and I asked him why. He says he was in pain, saying that he wants to end it so he no longer feels how he is anymore. I got more and more concerned as he spoke. I had no idea what to say. I know for a fact that he has the means and intent to do something like that, so I asked him if he was serious, why he was going to do it. He said he was serious and said he wanted to end his pain and that he didn't deserve to live anymore. 


I tried to tell him that I care about him and that I would miss him, his family and friends would, etc. Anything I could think of to say to him. He just shot everything down, saying he hates everyone and that his family and friends (including me) could ""fuck off and go to hell"" because he will be dead and won't have to deal with the consequences of his death. I pretty much was left crying my eyes out, left not knowing what to say. All I could say was ""your life matters to me, and I would be upset if you died"". After repeatedly saying he didn't care, he finally says ""do you think if I was actually going to kill myself I would be sitting here talking to you? No i wouldn't be"". 


He basically started to lash out against me, and I had nothing left to say. He had shrugged off anything I could think of to say. Right now, I am heading off to work and said he could call me and I would talk to him if he needed or wanted to talk. He didn't respond and just logged off of the game. Hasn't answered my texts or calls. It's not my fault I have to go to work and can't listen to him calling me a whore for the rest of the night. But I did offer to listen while I was at work. 


I honestly have no idea what to do anymore. I'm not sure how serious his threats were, and I have no idea where he lives, no contact other than his cell phone number. I don't know if I should reach out to his family members on Facebook or if that would cause more damage. ",suicide

I realize I'm not the only one who has had a shitty life, but it's about time I think about what I want. I can't even describe, or begin to tell you ladies and gentlemen the trauma and violence I've had to put up in the past and my current status is no better. Maybe not as violent? But the memories are still there and my life was ruined way before making this thread. I had a dream before making this thread. I would like to share with each individual's undivided attention. As I said before I've been through a lot of trauma. I have been through heart aches, violence, plenty lives have fell victim in my life and resulted into me watching death do it's part. I even was one of those victims or could've been after attempting my very 1st suicide and it resulted in me being pronounced dead for 5 minutes and that's being aided by medical personnel. I'm no war veteran or anything. I simply had possibly the worse luck in this game we play called life and it's like playing chess except I was the pawn, but that's just it? I was stuck being the pawn no matter how hard I tried to do the absolute necessary to change my life for the better and it failed miserably over and over and keep in mind? I was doing this all myself. I never had a shoulder to lean on or someone to be my side and say ""I love you and everything will be alright"". I don't have anyone to talk to and no one thinks I'm worthy enough of their time and never take me serious. Anyways sorry for going off topic, but this dream I had was a beautiful thing. At least in my eyes. That I was laying terminally ill in my bed in a dark room with a light shining down on me. Keep in mind I am not terminally ill, nor am I mocking those that are. In fact if you want my opinion? I rather take every disease someone has and pass it down to me because there are good people in this world that don't deserve to lose their lives. I know what to expect now. Someone will say "" well neither do you"" or ""what makes you so different from the rest of us""? Well forgive me for the only thing I can feel is my own suffering and hurting and not someone else's so of course I'm going to feel like I'm the only one at this moment with nothing to lose in which I don't and with the most pain. Life will be better without me and some will not understand me? And some might and even if you do show care? It's not genuine. Anyways I am sitting here playing with a loaded firearm I recently ripped off and stole. I know some will say "" we can't stop you "" nor do I expect anyone to, but you can say your worse to me and it has got to the point where if I were to recover from this? I'll just use all the hurtful things said to me as left over motivation to lead me back in the position I am right now. Take care to all of you and thank you for letting me say my final peace.

I have done everything. I have a 40 hour a week job. I exercise no less than 3 times a week. I had sex. I did meditation, even trying to join a new religion. I have gone to 3 different therapists. I have played tabletop games.

I've did everything people told me that I just needed to try out. Guess what: I still want to die. It has gotten worse. I can't stop thinking about dying. I constantly am daydreaming about people being beaten to death. There is no morality. I don't even know what's right or wrong anymore. Any moral system that I try gets ""UHM ACKTUALLY"" 'd by some psudo philosophical idiot nihilist redditor that rules the modern world now. Worst part is that I have no good argument against them. It really is meaningless.

2001,"my life has become a nightmareTnis will be a long read but I'm very grateful for those who will read it. I'm going to start this off by saying I've never been a happy person. I've always seeked solace in philosophy &amp; drugs. I've done numerous drugs to try and help me. LSD, shrooms, tons of benzos &amp; opiates, MDMA, but they always only help temporarily. I've been depressed. Always. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I can't remember the way I was before it ever came into my life. But life somehow started looking up for me, I had a well paying job, drugs, close friends, a girlfriend, a car, and just my freedom. I had everything I've ever wanted in life. I wasn't happy but I was content and had a hope for my future.

Until two weeks ago where I made the worst decison of my life ; that was driving when I was fucked up. I was coming home from a day filled with popping pills and smoking with friends, &amp; I made the most selfish, stupid decision of driving under various substances. I swerved and my wheel came off the road, lost traction and pummeled me into a pickup truck. I was on the highway going 60. My car got totalled. Ambulance had to bust the windows in the back because my car flipped to get me out.I was fine besides hurting my neck and some major bruises. But I admitted in the emergency room that I was messed up &amp; under various drugs. I got arrested and charged for wreckless driving, DUI, &amp; plenty of drug charges they found in my car after. I'm failing all my classes. I've always had a great GPA, a really good ACT score to get me into a decent college with a nice scholarship but ive ruined that future. Besides losing my future, friends, job, car, money, freedom, &amp; my reputation. I put two other people in the hospital. 

One of them is a father. Has kids. &amp; He's been in the hospital since. He has a broken neck &amp; in a lot of pain. I couldn't imagine what I would do to some fucker who almost killed my mom because of their dumbass decisions. Ive been living with the guilt since. That I almost killed another person, almost made some kids live without their father. I'm the lowest person and I honestly feel like I don't deserve to live. I wish I never wore my searbelt, that I was killed in the crash. I truly deserve it. Insurance isn't going to cover any medical bills. I put myself and my mom in thousands of dollars in debt. We cant afford that. She works as a single mother, supporting three kids as a fast food manager. Besides contemplating suicide daily because of living with this guilt amd regret that eats me up 24/7. Ive lost everything. I've become a disgrace to my family, to society. My brother tells me daily how I should've died &amp; how much of a piece of shit I am. My dad was a drug addict who left our family at the age of 6, and my mom &amp; brother tell me how I'm far worse than him. It hurts so fucking much. All of this does. I can't bear this emotional pain. I never meant to hurt anyone in my entire life. Ive always been so nice and caring to others because I know life is hard &amp; I only wish to bring good to others. But I've fucked my life up beyond repair.  

I don't see a way out of this. I don't want one. I just wish I had the fucking balls to end this guilt and misery I feel ALL the fucking time. I can't keep living. I don't deserve to. The only person who has a little faith in me is my girlfriend. I love this girl to death. She's the most amazing person I've ever met. Shes the only one who has faith in me &amp; support me. But I can't even see her with no car. I don't have a phone to talk to her. I'm probably going to lose her too. I hate that I'm making people suffer because of my decisons. These poor people I almost killed, my family, my girlfriend, my friends. I've truly lost everything. I hope so much that I just can end it all. To stop feeling this misery. To never have to see another day. Hopefully one day I will. Thank you for reading.",suicide

Today thoughts about suicide became my everyday routine before I go to sleep.

I never wanted my life to be this way. But this is how it is. 

One thing that I wish more than anything is that one lucky day I will have real opportunity to do it. When I'll be all alone and I'll be in right mood. I'll drink some alcohol and hang myself.

Or maybe I'm just a pussy, or going out hannah baker style isn't how I want to go.

I think i'll make a bucket list before I die. There's a few things I want to do before I die. I've never eaten a steak before, I think I'll try that. I did check off one thing from my bucket list today now that I think about it. I think I'll revisit some old memories from when I was a kid, the area isn't far from me. 

I'm good looking, funny, confident, great hair, great voice, i have women, i have money, but I'm not happy. My entire personality feels empty, I just emulate whatever character I've seen before, for whatever suits the situation. I don't really feel like a person. When i'm not trying to emulate anyone, all I really am is just angry, edgy, unfunny, blunt, and above all just stubborn. My refusal to change as I grew up is ultimately why I am suffering, my suffering has always been my own fault.

I realised that my attitudes towards women and my outlook on life stems from my deep hatred of my mother, growing up and even now I wanted nothing more for her to die and suffer. I wish I had talked about this to someone earlier. Maybe I would have been able to become someone more functional. I suppose the feeling of betrayal from the person I loved most will never leave me, it will always hurt, and I just can't seem to forget. 

My wrists really hurt, i'm in no danger of dying anymore, I'm just dizzy and want water. Maybe I don't even want to die, if i truly dead I wouldn't be alive right now. Or perhaps its the natural instinct to survive that's restricting me?",suicide

Literally got a suitcase and put it in front of her, only for her to decide to stay. She has also gone back to sleeping with him.

2039,"I have multiple mental illnesses and after an unlucky layoff, have been unemployed for 1.5 years so I will be choosing between suicide and ??? very soon. Open to unusual suggestions.**Just read the bold text as a TL/DR if you want.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: I graduated with a useless liberal arts degree - German - that I deeply regret in December 2014. The winter graduation date was a result of taking a semester off due to incapacitating mental health issues. I have a little OCD, some Borderline Personality Disorder traits, and am formally diagnosed as Bipolar Type II. I take a high dose of Lamictal but due to the nature of my diagnosis I am somewhat medication resistant and therapy has never helped much either. I fight intrusive thoughts and extreme depression on a daily basis. **I have spent 3 out of the 4 years since I graduated unemployed.** It took me a year to find a job. I was laid off from that job after only a year there because the company was doing poorly. That happened just eight months after I had left my parents' house. I didn't even make it a year on my own. That was a year and a half ago. I cannot find a fucking job. I have tried everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The reality is that someone with almost no experience and no connections and can only rely on the internet to find work is dealing with so much competition that it is almost impossible to find a job without a STEM degree. Over the past month, for example, I have applied to 185 jobs and only made it to a 2nd round in-person interview 4 times. So here we are...* 

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm ready to die. I have a note and a plan.** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have just one friend IRL who I rarely see or hear from. On my steam friends list there is one person who I game with sometimes, he is a great friend who I have known for a couple years but we have never met. My relationship with my parents is nonexistent even though I live with them. We have never been close and they have done some fucked up things in the past. **There is very little guilt associated with the thought of leaving the 4 people who are part of my life behind.** I have read enough of r/SuicideBereavement to know what it'd do to them and I don't care most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **My suicide method of choice is irreversible. Guaranteed to kill me.** This will not be one of those impulsive acts where someone didn't take enough pills or jumped off of a building that wasn't high enough. I will be gone. Thus, I must be very certain about having no other options left. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Your life might be very different from mine and therefore you'll say ""why not just find a retail or food service job and accept living with your parents?"" *That is not something I can accept*. I didn't push through my terrible mental health issues to graduate with honors to live a life like this.** This house is full of traumatic memories and as depressed as I am now, there is no way I could work at Macy's or Applebees and be stuck in this house indefinitely without getting even worse and killing myself**. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **I refuse to be hospitalized and will not do outpatient either.** I was too honest with my psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and almost got myself involuntarily committed. I have a very bad attitude about therapy and meds. Trapping me in a fucking looney bin with nothing but a smock would inevitably lead to me assaulting someone and having even more problems. I refuse to be doped up on meds to the point where I think this situation is fucking fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**At this point, I don't know what the fuck I can do. Here are the things that occur to me at this point, in order from most reasonable to least:** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sign up for a temp agency and hope to find a ""temp to permanent"" role that actually pans out. The problem with those jobs is that they do not pay enough to get me out of this fucking house, even if it is full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept that my life has fallen apart and that I need to start over and go back to school for a degree that is actually useful. That plan would prevent waiting tables or something awful like that from bringing me to suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Get a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) certification and leave this country for somewhere with a low cost of living. It is going down in flames and I have almost nothing keeping me here anyway. I have a car that is worth around $10,000 that I could sell to get out of here and pay for the certification. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept my suicide as inevitable - living with all of these conditions is fucking terrible - and do something radical like selling the aforementioned car and blowing my money on some kind of cross country trip or even a one way ticket to somewhere else. $10k gets you a long way in a third world country. You may laugh at this but I'm actually kind serious about this one. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kill myself. Send my note to everyone as a text before doing it. That's it. This miserable existence I never asked for would be over. I have had sex, fallen in love, been to Europe, enjoyed meaningful friendships, done psychedelics. Its been nice. But I can't take this shit anymore at the same time. Every day is the same. Sitting at this fucking desk. Miserable. Insane. Lonely. Hopeless. I think about suicide constantly.

2050,"Never thought I'd be having suicidal thoughts.I don't really care that this is my main account.

I'm currently camping with my four best friends in the world. We planned this trip for ages and now it's actually happening, but once again my mental illness ruins things for everyone. Last night I freaked out because they wanted to go for a walk in the woods at midnight without phone signal and I was terrified they might die. One of my friends gave me a much deserved talking to and said that the world shouldn't revolve around me, which is of course right. I shouldn't be controlling them, it's just the anxiety talking.

I stayed up with my absolute best friend and another friend until three, when we decided to go to bed. However, despite knowing I was in a fragile mental state my best friend decides to go off and leave me upset. I messaged them asking just to chat because I was lonely, to be told that I was making a big deal out of nothing and I should forget about it. You can't just forget anxiety issues, they're always there.

I cried myself to sleep, then woke early this morning shaking. Some mean part of me wanted to make them worry about me as much as I worry about them, so I took my blanket and went for a long walk in the woods to see if I could spot some wild boar. I got back after about an hour but noone had contacted me asking where I was even though I knew they were awake, so I went and sat by the cafe and browsed reddit until one friend found me. She said she'd been looking everywhere for me and that my best friend was worried sick. I was finally happy - he actually cared.

When we got back to the tent, he was asleep. I don't know about you but when I'm worried sick about someone I don't fall asleep until they're found. I left again. I'm now sat by the cafe again crying my eyes out. I'm always there for them, but I never feel like they care for me at all. I'm entertaining suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life - maybe if I killed or seriously injured myself they'd finally care about me? I'm tempted to make myself throw up right now so they might actually take me seriously. I'm a disgrace, and everyone's fed up with me. At least if I killed myself they'd actually care.",suicide

Of course people who love you would miss you. I would miss you. It would be devastating!""   That seems little short of guilt tripping.  I won't say it's totally ineffective, but I kind of expected more from a DBT intensive therapist.  Or does DBT assume that the greatest motivation is positive attention? Because it totally leverages the therapuetic relationship like it means more to me than anything else in the world.  Like, Sorry, you're ok and all, but you're just my therapist. I don't even know you.  Self harm has been officially unamed ""unacceptable,"" and is punnishable by 24 hours of no contact/no phone coaching.  Phone coaching, the thing they're supposed to try to get you to use instead of trying (again) to kill yourself... If somebody's so desperate they're self-harming, possibly with intent to kill.  You can totally fix it by leveraging the need for continued attention against the need to feel better at any cost.  For the love of god, why is there the assumption someone really just wants attention more than anything, and if they get it for being ""good"" (presenting as asymptomatic) and not for being ""bad"" (symptomatic), they'll stop self harming or attempting suicide (being symptomatic)?   You cannot just *manipulate* me out of being suicidal.  That's not how this works.  I came to DBT for a robust empirically proven form of therapy that is supposedly... heavy-duty, or industrial strength or whatever.  Supposedly perfect for severely depressed chronically suicidal people.  That's what I came for, but I'm not sure what it is that I'm getting.  It assumes people are illogical attention-motivated children above all else.   While I'm not some mastermind genius, I find that pretty insulting.  What, do I get a gold star for each day without self-harm, too?  I know! Let's go full out in behaviorism and do a token economy.  /s  I'm studying psychology and neuroscience, and this shit does not jive with what I've been taught to expect of DBT.  I'm disappointed, really.  Flat out salty.  That and it's full of jargon that I can hardly begin to parse out.  My therapist says I need to work on my Committment to Living like it's a proper noun or something. Oh and Mindfulness as a cure to everything including all misery of existence.  I don't like mindfulness, I actually kind of hate it, and the deep breathing bullshit too.  It doesn't work.

Okay that sounded wrong, i know i'm going to hurt them if i disappear but it's not going to much of a mind fuck like a suicide would be. At least that's what i think. Anyway Reddit if you want to see it, tell me and i'll make a post before i go live okay?",suicide
2064,"I want to die honorableI don't know if this is suicidal but I want to die in a way that I myself find glorious. While I know I would never harm myself willingly, I yet desire to cease existing.   
But as the good nature in me calls for doing something good and helping others I want to die in a battle. I would like to join some militia or organization that fights terror groups or generally saves other people so I could at least do something good for other people one last time before I leave.  
And in case I don't die from that then great. But I doubt it because I am not good. I have never been to the military because my health problems are too much of a burden. And where I live almost every male goes to the military at adult age. So I also feel like I am missing out on something important even though I don't regret having to go there. But yet perhaps that would make it up for this. I mean someone without experience like me will die fast anyway, right? So doing something good and something I feel proud of while leaving with honorable actions is just the perfect setup.   
Because else I am just a burden and non-loved by anyone. I cannot love myself because I can only do that if others love me as well. I am the kind of person that depends on others. I have to push myself and if I can't go on I just feel horrible.  
For years I have tried following my dreams, actually doing my best to achieve things in life but all failed. Sure I tried and did my best, there is nothing more I can do. But this is exactly what bothers me. If my best isn't enough to continue, what else can I do? You don't wanna see me try my worst if my best is already that horrible...  
And I had enough always having to fight for things I never get in the end while others get it laid out on their hands. Be it job and career or love life.   
Sure I have friends and family, I have a roof over my head and food on the plate.   
But life is more than just surviving, especially in these times where society expects much more of someone.  
I often say I just wanna die but when I say I wanna die I really just mean I wanna finally start living and not just surviving like right now. But the more days pass, the more I think perhaps it actually is for the better if I do die.  
Today it pushed me on the edge, I had to hold a blade to my throat and chest for the first time in many many years. To think I really be pushed that hard...  
But I don't know why for some reason I still do have hope. I kinda always have hope for something. I cannot explain this phenomenon. Even if I think I plan to die in battle, I yet have hope to leave it alive and gaining new experience and mindset that could change me positively. Even in such negativity, I find positivity. But this all is a double-edged sword. the one side that has hope that something good could happen but the other side that is right now a bit sharper than the other, the side that just wants me to die.  
Does anyone else feel like this? Can you understand this?  
And yes I am already trying to get help but I will not know the outcome in the end of all this",suicide

Gas is something you have to pay for there, which they voted on (red state). republicans dont think gas should be provided by the government and because they voted against it, it isn't. It was a really bad snowstorm as a result of climate change (one of the worst in texas history, and they don't get much snow there).

So, some people can't afford the gas and the concern is they'll freeze to death in their own homes because they don't have gas. Gas isn't just heat either, their water isn't being treated by the state right now and stoves aren't working to cook. 

At least 25 people have died as of 24 hours ago. To give you an idea of it 3 kids died when they accidentally lit their house on fire trying to stay warm and a man was found frozen to death in his recliner.

2113,"I feel ugly, and it makes me feel like I have less value as a person.I deal with body dysmorphia. Not that the things I see don't exist, but I realize that I obsess over my appearance more than most people do.

I find myself hideous. My face slants. It's fucked up that I couldn't just have a normal face. Doesn't have to be gorgeous. But I mean, my whole fucking face slants to the side. Logically, I know that people probably don't care. But I constantly think about when I am talking to people. I see it. I obsess over plastic surgery. I obsess over ways to make it less noticeable. It's going to cost around $20-30,000 if I want to fix it. Part of the problem is I have a cross under bite. So it makes my jaw slant to the left. But then I have a droopy eye. Which looks more apparent because of the slanted jaw. If I want to get the eye fixed that's around $3-5000. Even my fucking ears are slanted. My face looks like I had bell's palsy, but without the complete loss of muscle movement in the side of my face. 

These things aren't in my head. I wish I had full on body dysmorphia where I just see things that aren't real. I've posted on /r/rateme and people have pointed out exactly the things I see. When I was a kid and got my ears pierced at the mall, they said they normally would pierce one ear a little higher and the other a little lower to make them look symmetrical. However, my ears are so crooked that they couldn't even do that. You can't even surgically fix crooked ears.  Today I went and got botox, and the lady recommended that I get microblading for my eyebrows because it would make my eye look less droopy. Which of course I'm going to do (but not with her), because if I can make myself look less crooked for a couple hundred bucks then yes I'm going to do it. Beats the several thousand. 


My family thinks I'm vain. Which I guess I am. But you know, that's pretty freaking easy for them to say. Somehow I was the only one born with a half smashed face. I'm the ugly duckling. But I'm superficial because I want to get work done to make myself look normal. 

I understand that I'm being shallow. Of course people still will talk to me even if I'm ugly. I'm great at making friends. But you know what I'm not good at? Getting guys I love to stay. They move on to much prettier girls. I'm the girl they date while they have low self-esteem. I have a nice body. I'm the girl they want to hit and quit. You bang the body, but you marry for the face. 

I just don't think I'll be at peace in my head until I get the surgeries done. But I can't afford them. Sure, you'll probably tell me that it won't make me happy. I call bull shit. When I was younger, I had an eating disorder. I hated my body. I hated my thighs and wanted that coveted thigh gap. Now, years later, I work out, and like I said, I have a good body with curves. But I also now have that coveted thigh gap. And you know what? I fucking love it. It makes me feel good that I can stand with my feet together and my thighs don't touch.

They listened in the first little while when things got really bad but now I’m just annoying to them. I’ve been going through a prolonged period of being suicidal (I’m talking fucking years dude) and I’m experiencing a serious spike right now. Everything is something I could kill myself with. Electrical cord is a noose. Could drop a hair dryer into my bathtub. Slit my wrists with the xacto set I bought to try and feel better and make something instead of doing nothing. I can’t hold down a job, I’m living at home, isolated. I have a boyfriend but he just isn’t helping. The feeling, the itch to kill my self is too strong. I keep trying to get him to leave the house so I can just do it. I’m terrified of death but between the depression and chronic physical pain due to it and the isolation, I can’t feel anything. I’m either numb or crying and this has been going on for weeks. I’m back to forgetting what even a fleeting moment of happiness is. And to top it off, the only thing I’ve been looking forward to for months, the only thing I’ve been trying to live for I can’t go to anymore. I’m a failure and I have nothing and not even my dog likes me. I’m better off dead. 

A few days ago I was just lying on the floor in the garage. I’d been trying to build something to keep busy but the materials my dad said we had weren’t right and I just spiralled. I laid on the concrete floor and when my mom came in the first thing she said was that she couldn’t take it anymore. It being me being suicidal and depressed. She wanted to send me to a hospital (despite the last time me going, I got misdiagnosed and put on Effexor which made my life an unlivable hell) instead of just being a parent when all I said literally a day prior was I was cripplingly lonely. They willingly put themselves out of the house on the weekends so I’m just alone. They won’t even take a single day to spend with me. The every next day they left me alone again. 

I feel like I’ve regressed back into a teenager. I would have been committed if my boyfriend didn’t take a fifty dollar Uber to get to me and stop the whole thing from happening.

2135,"It came back.I am a M(12). I live in a very christian neighborhood.I have attempted suicide in 2017, but have obviously failed. After that I started seeking out help keeping it a secret from everyone including my parents. I recovered by the mid-end of spring 2018, and have accidentally told some people that I have attempted suicide, but luckily they think it was a joke.

The reason for the depression (I have never actually been diagnosed but had all of the symptoms) is abuse I have been yelled at and beaten since kindergarten (about 5 years old) and have been humiliated and bullied for my looks (overweight) since the start of primary school. And increasing pressure to fulfill my high expectations (straight As). And during all of this being told that the abuse was ""normal"".

Ever since my recovery I have been making efforts to get slimmer which were mostly stopped by my parents saying that I cant go on a diet because I was so young (instead of a diet I just started eating healthier), my dad stopped beating me because he knew I was getting stronger (working out) and would fight back. But the emotional manipulation and verbal abuse did not stop. 

On the start of august I was staying at my Aunts and Uncles house for a week. And that week was great, because I had no expectations, I kept working out, I kept a stable weight, I had a cat who made it way less lonely being inside most of the time. But then I came back home. And on the SECOND DAY of me being back my dad just came out of nowhere and tried to kiss me, but my arm got in the way. Immediately he started yelling at me saying that I have no respect for him, that I do not know what love, and that I do not love him, and how ungrateful I am for all he has done for me. He also yelled that    he will take away all my rights including free speech. And whenever I tried to say anything he would cut me off and yell ""DO NOT ANSWER ME!"". He said that he hated how I was relaxed when he started yelling at me.

This is after another similar case that happened a few weeks ago when we went on a walk and he started yelling at me because food is not all I want from him. As I said this is similar to the case described above. Except that in this one I had a mental breakdown, he punched me, and gave me a promise that we will never get angry at each other ever again (I knew this was bullshit) except if I ""screw up"".

And the day after he yelled at me, made me cry enough to fill 100 of those ""male tears"" mugs, and broke a promise. The next day he acted as if nothing happened. One thing he got right that night is that I do not love him, I realized I do not love him 2 years ago. If it was not for the laws of this country I would have murdered him, but I could not even defend myself because of how emotionally overwhelmed I was, I could not say anything I just imagined killing him.

And ever since that day the suicidal thoughts came back, slowly but they did. And now I do not have emotional support I don't know who to tell this, except you.",suicide

2142,"It's been One YearI kind of have a weird tradition I've been technically doing for nearly a decade now, though it's also sort of off and on. See, every year after my most recent suicide attempt, I celebrate it's anniversary. Whether it's a treat to myself or, as was with this past Wednesday, spending the day with myself, I look back on the day I last attempted. I refect on the year and whether or not I think it's been worth surviving.

However, this past ""anniversary"" was the first one I could actually celebrate in about four years. Since my first one, I've attempted seven times, and four of those have been stopping said celebration for just under half a decade. You'd think I'd have gotten better since it's finally been a year, right?

There's not that urge to go and jump off something or to slice myself open, but rather a void that's growing inside. Not necessarily something that is sucking me dry, but rather attempting to fill me up with the emptiness. I'm constantly trying to fight this, but I'm thrown a curve ball each time.

There's nothing I can do, is there? There's no point in celebrating if I keep losing. I'm just hurting so much, and I know I'm too broken to be fixed. If I can't even appreciate the year since my last attempt, what's the point?",suicide

It’s not like I really have any friends or am good at socializing so I couldn’t have a birthday party anyways, but still not doing much other than getting Denny’s has left me feeling like I didn’t get the magic of a birthday, especially one that’s typically considered on of your landmark birthday (your 1st, your 10th, your 13th, your 16th, your 18th, and your 21st are the ones I think are typically the big ones.) my birthday is almost over anyways (it’s 11:31 PM here) so I’m not sure why I’m really posting anything, but I kind of just felt like making a post somewhere where others may understand.

I'm so afraid that I'm not good enough for my boyfriend. I'm not good enough for my parents or my family. I have virtually no friends. Nobody cares about me except for my boyfriend but I know I'm wearing him down.

I was raped when I was 16 by a random man. He pushed me against the wall and pinned me by wrapping his hands around my neck. He pulled off my pants and began to feel around before he pulled down his own pants and raping me. I've never told anyone this until now, but his memory haunts me every night.

When I was younger my father used to grope me and when I reached puberty he began to touch me even more inappropriately. To this day, I can't look at my father the same way.

My boyfriend and I just recently started having sex. He's my first, besides that man. He doesn't know about this, but sometimes when we're intimate...I just get flash backs of that night when I was raped, and sometimes of my father.

I live every day scared, scared of running into that man once more. Scared of losing the only person that cares about me. Scared of my father touching me. 

My parents abuse me. They choke me until I pass out, and throw things at me. Things that would break bones or skin if I didn't dodge out of the way. They hit me almost every day just because they can.

I don't have the social skills or life skills to make my life any better because I am a terrific failure. I've learned to surround myself with people who wouldn't judge or criticize me even for my own good. I stopped talking to a lot of my family but they didn't want anything to do with myself or my dad and siblings anyway. I've wanted to die for more than 13 years. I'm really really tired. The only thing that would drive me when I was younger was thinking eventually I could support myself making artwork and music or just creating. As much as it's the only emotional outlet I have left I realize how pointless it is without already being wealthy. I work retail. I will never afford an education. Taking loans is suicide anyway.  I hate myself and I'm fully aware of the deep resentment most people feel for the fact that myself and people like me exist. I am going to kill myself eventually because I can't possibly live in the us being who I am. Escapism was really the last thing I had left.

2172,"I was told to post hereHello,

So I made [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/jwwh9/dae_have_suicidal_thoughts_on_a_daily_basis/) last night somebody told me to make a post here. 

So basically I've been having suicidal thoughts for a few years now - thoughts like how I'd kill myself, who would be effected, what if anything would happen to me afterwards. Never really crossed into serious planning, but at one point I put aside a bottle of Oxycotin and Vodka and hid it in my bookcase. It's made me feel really good to just have it sit there, but I have no plans to use it.

I don't think I'm depressed - I'll have my waves of bad thoughts but I'd say a good 80% of my day is me having genuine fun and being happy. 

I just don't really know where to go from here. I thought the suicidal thoughts I was having were as normal as people's murder/rape thoughts. Happens a few times a day but never anything serious, so no harm no foul, right? But reading some comments last night and this morning have led me to believe that suicidal thoughts are not normal, but I'm pretty confident mine are just thoughts and will never lead to actions.

Should I just go on with my life like normal?",suicide

2192,"Extreme anxiety over potential crime, advice neededI (19M) have been struggling tremendously with OCD, especially recently, and my recent intrusive thoughts are causing me tremendous anxiety and rumination.

Relatively recently (think a few weeks/months ago), I messaged multiple girls from nsfw subreddits such as gonewild.  Nearly every single time, there was no reply.  However, my mind just thought of something which is giving me tremendous anxiety.  What if the people I messaged were underaged, even though I didn’t know about it?  I always subconsciously assumed, due to those subreddits having an 18+ limit, that I would only be messaging adults, however my mind is going insane thinking that they may have been underaged.  I never thought that I was messaging anybody underaged, and if I ever had reasonable suspicion that a person was, I would never have even thought about messaging them.

I don’t know how valid it is, but I’m just thinking that what I did is a horrible crime and that I’m going to get sentenced to prison for multiple years for what I did.  I’m incredibly anxious that I’m in some kind of legal trouble due to what I did.  This is my sole cause of the anxiety.  If there is any lawyer or person with extensive legal knowledge, could they please comment and let me know if I am going to go to prison for this.

I swear, I never knowingly messaged an underaged person.  To this day, every person I have messaged, I do not have a single reason to believe was underaged.

I makes me think a lot about how people just pick and choose what they want to see for their own happiness. It’s a weird feeling. I feel bad for these people who aren’t getting this necessary attention from a group of people they are trying to share their hardest  struggles with, but then it also makes me feel weirdly good I’m not the only one who is neglected by the open public. I see one post with hundreds of upvotes, but the next with ten. The thing that saddens me is that there is no way to fix that. Just like the real world, we can’t fix and help everybody, and our standpoint is to always help ourselves first. This is really random but whatever.",suicide

I feel like I’m too sensitive for this world. And that sensitivity is seen as a negativity by most, I care about people too much, I get attached and when I’m scared to lose them I end up pushing them away because I’m too intense in wanting to let them know how valued they are to me. Most recently a friend from work, who i admitted having feelings for when drunk on a night out, who was a good friend. A month ago she was telling me how thoughtful I was due to the gifts I’d got her. Now, she wants nothing to do with me and I know it’s basically because I sent a way too intense text about still wanting to retain the friendship.

This has been a pattern for me - I develop these great friendships and then get close and ruin it - with my best friend after we had kissed and now with this colleague. I try and rein it in but I just can’t help it. With this lady, I genuinely felt we flirted and feel stupid for misreading the signs, she had been getting touchy feely a bit towards the end, patting my butt and joking I was her work-husband (she is single).

When this happens I feel it erases all the positive things they thought about me, because one mistake and I end up losing all that, so it doesn’t matter how funny they found me, how thoughtful she thought I was, in the end I just ruin it.

I don’t feel I have anything to offer because the positive traits weren’t enough and I feel like I’m just not good enough and there must be something fundamentally wrong with me. My ex told me she loved me, spent one week on holiday with me after she cried 2 hours after getting there due to homesickness, and after 2 weeks of looking after her dumped me when we got back. From ‘soulmate’ to dumping me after 10 days together where I pretty much just looked after her and cancelled my trip early to get her back home (I had planned it for a year and spent a lot of money).

I feel like I’m too sensitive for a man, and that I’m not attractive due to it and have nothing to offer and could never be in a long relationship or close friendship due to how sensitive I am. And that I just at care too much about people and get hurt when they leave.

And I really am just tired of it now. I’m 31 but I feel like I’ve been struggling for so long.",suicide

2236,At what point is suicide acceptable? How many more days/months/years do I have to wait?28 year old female over here woo fucking hoo. Been depressed suicidal on and off since I can remember. Couple of failed attempts in my teens. It's been 8 months since my depression hit hard again. I keep setting a date then moving it. At this point if I try I'm not going to fail. Gotta buy a gun still. Been doing my research on how best to succeed. Just trying to plot the end. At what age is it finally going to be reasonable to throw in the towel? Do I really need to wait it out for years until it becomes so blaringly obvious that this life isn't worth the trouble. Seems like I've already figured that out but I keep holding on just in case. Not many more years left before spinsterdom sets in. Maybe 30? If I can make it that long. I don't know something's gotta give. I'm no spring chicken. I don't want to grow old and alone. At a certain point my life goals will be out of reach and I'll be left with nothing. At that time suicide is fair. It's just. It's reasonable. At this time I'm just waiting for my father to die so I don't have anyone to hurt. Maybe I answered my own question when he goes I will too. I just feel like if I set a reasonable date and stick to it all this pressure will be lifted. I'll have a goal. Just make it through until that date. I can do that. it's the unending road thats daunting. If there's a date I can compartmentalize. I can rest easy knowing the end is in sight. But when???,suicide
2237,"I see it quite clearly now. Suicide IS the best option for me.I've been meditating a lot recently and I've come to the conclusion that there simply is no reason for me to be here. I don't like or care for anything in the world. I don't understand why someone with a mental illness would want to get better. There is nothing on the other end. I guess there is for some people, but not for me. Not because no one cares for me, some do, but because I don't care for anyone or anything. I don't care that my family will miss me and wonder what they did wrong. They did nothing wrong except for creating me. None of this would've happened had I not existed, and that's their burden to bear. I have hobbies to pass the time. When I don't think much about it I like them. When I actually think deeply about it I realise how pointless they are.

I guess I would like to be convinced otherwise, but none of your false optimism is going to sway me. Things could get better, sure, but if I was dead I would never know, so what's the point in risking even more suffering for myself? As I said, the suffering of others is of no concern to me.

I'm here to talk to whoever would love to talk to someone.  
I'm a 22 year old female who has been blessed with good opportunities in life. I had a terrible bout in high school where I felt I went insane. I felt I had no control over my emotions, thoughts, and at times my own actions. I was put on medication and was almost sure I self-diagnosed myself with BPD. Fast forward a few years and I quit the meds and am mentally stable, even truly happy. 

But the last month or two things have been dwindling it feels. I have always been a daily bud smoker, but my alcohol consumption upped and I'm feeling best when asleep. This morning I woke up feeling empty, nothing. I couldn't get myself out of bed and had to call into work. I spent all day sleeping because being asleep is almost like not being alive... a small coma. I wouldn't consider suicide these days, but also some days I really wouldn't mind not being alive.

My psychiatrist believes that depression is a teenage fad. I haven't made any friends since I was 12, and it was the only close friend I've ever had. We're parted now. I am truly alone. Entrusive thoughts about self-harm and suicide make cold run down my limbs.

My dissertation is also getting ruined by the tardiness of labs and my team member, who is too busy with her own research to care for mine. Yes, the most appealing solution would be to shift labs, but it is going to take me eons to do that, and my samples(which are biological) will get destroyed all the same. So even though i have put in more effort than most of my classmates, i am staring on the brink of failure and i badly want to give up.   
I don't have anything to live for except the fact that it will make my family unhappy. I have a few online friends i care for, but beyond that, i have no social life worth talking about. I decided to avoid relationships after my gf's death from cancer last year, which is again a source of continuous mental turmoil. And the therapists in my country are assholes, besides, i simply cannot spare any time for therapy.   
Why should i not die? Is there any point in continuing to embarrass myself further? People keep telling me about how these failures are making me stronger, but they're not. Im 26 and i should've completed my education long ago. This isn't a fantasy world where a person has unlimited resources and time. I have never come across a worse phrase than ""failures are the stepping stones of success"". Perhaps its applicable for people who don't have much to lose.

Not like I have an answer, the past, present and future key to our survival is a well functioning and productive society, not the well being of free radicals. But I have to add that depression isn't an illness, the norm is. Depressed people are more likely to realistically judge a situation.

I'll try once again, and maybe a few times after that. But after a fixed age, and without any solid improvement, I'm just going to call it quits. I'll have years upon years of proof that life isn't worth it. I won't be repeating the same experiment and expecting different results.",suicide

I stumbled over to her, my massive shaft swaying from side-to-side, rocking the whole house with it. Upon closer inspection, her giant conkers were even more impressive that I'd first thought. Sprinkled lightly with freckles, like a perfectly peppered biscuit, she had the most beautiful bongos I'd ever gazed upon.

I let out a primal yell and immediately entered her, causing her to spout cum violently before completing the first thrust. We were still clothed. Such was the power of my immense man meat that I penetrated her clothing and simultaneously found entrance to her clitoris. Like climbing some massive mossy meat mountain, I erected my shaft at the top and declared victory. This wasn't my first sexual encounter. I've had sex with at least 9 other women. Still, something about this one was special.

Still inside her, I could feel her ovaries trembling. My gigantic cock had curled inside her like fruit by the foot, now spurting from her mouth as if a great cum-fountain.

I'm 27 year old female. My story is this:

My dad was violent and alcoholic in my youth. Me and my siblings got used to live in fear. My mother ditched him when I was seven, only 'cause my little brother got cancer (if he would've gotten abused while being sick, he could've died). He survived, but I was always put aside (naturally, 'cause he was sick and I was healthy). I was good at school, I've always liked it. Fast forward to age 15. I was raped. It ruined me. I started to drink (a lot), and to hang with older guys. I started to date one. I moved in with him when in high school. Drinking was our favorite hobby. He also introduced me to some drugs (cannabis, LSD, MDMA etc.) Then... I tried to kill myself. I nearly succeeded (death was few minutes away).

All my life I've been abandoned, neglected and traumatized, got around 50 traumata. I am alone, I have no family as they are totally shitty. My ""friends"" also abandoned me, I'm just not good enough or too annoying.

One of the first things I did around midnight (almost 1am now) is posting a depressing meme to reddit which I prepared an hour before. Whilst crying. I am sitting alone in my room and nobody is here. I feel dead inside and at the same time like I'm about to explode.

My head is constantly having thoughts like ""What could we do today? What about overdosing on painkillers or so?"" or before when I was in a subway thinking that I should better be below it and that's really annoying. Also I know that it's not the best way anyway and I wouldn't want to involve others in such a thing. That'd be awful. It is my 22nd birthday and I feel like I should ask for an apology that I wasn't aborted. Everyone resents me in the end and there's nothing I can do about it.

My whole family is hateful and especially towards me, my mother which whom I also cut contact by now confirmed that my father would likely be glad if I committed suicide. I just wanna vanish. I can't because I lost someone to suicide and this feeling - I just can't make the ones I love feel like that. As much as I want to cease to exist.

I. Hate. Everything.

I don't know what to do and I don't know why I am even writing this when I don't actually intend to do anything? Whatever. In a month I am 2 years selfharm-free (used to cut myself heavily) and even that doesn't cause any emotions but missing having a way to cope. Eating disorder flaring up so I get at least a fake sense of control. Maybe I die from this, then nobody loses me to suicide, chance is 15%. But maybe another of my diseases gets me first.

He swallowed the gas while bullet found dasher and done cpr and passed out as well.

I had so many fights, but yet I can't revolt against them more than I already did cause I need this damn job.

So I'm super stressed at work but when I go back home there's my damn family situation, my mom says in 5 days the judge is coming to our home to see what can be taken away and sold so the state can get his tax money back, the ones my dad wasn't able to pay. ""Fortunately"" (I don't really care) they said if we give them 4000 euro right now they'll make us a payment plan for the restant 40000 euros... So I'll have to ""lend"" my money to my dad again (I know I'll never see them back) this month and the same story comes along every damn month.
My dad has debts everywhere, I don't even know how much, and my mom says I'll have to hold on for other like 3-4 years in this cursed situation. 
But this is just an random estimate. I'm forced in this situation, I'm 23 years old and don't know when I'll be free, maybe when I'll be 30?
Our home is under risk every month.

Then, even worst, my mom is sick, she can't work, my dad left and betrayed her, I DON'T love her but I feel forced to take care of here until she dies or takes away her own life.
I don't have any mental illness, I'd like to become a music producer, to make money, I think love is so stupid and I don't care for anyone other than my self, and I believe everyone is egoistic too in the deep inside, but yet I'm scared of death, feel so coward. Hanging hurts, ""mortal"" electrical towers are not mortal at all, the only thing I could do right now would be to take the knife I usually take to my job, which has a new sharp blade and cut my throat but I'm so scared of how it would hurt, and I'm so stupidly worried about the shock I'll cause to my mom...

But now I think that the things that I'm drawing are nothing but edgy trash, with my mental health issues  cheaply splattered over bad art skills,  because I'm a shitty attention seeking idiot. I can't seem to be able to draw anything that isn't edgy.

I hate this word. Edgy. No wonder I can't look at my own art without feeling gross. 

I just read through other people's abuse histories and life struggles. And here I am, pondering what shade of ugu sobstory I wanna paint with, to represent my inner struggle of lying in a smelly bad and feeling sorry for myself.

If I am edgy, I want to die. I already am so many things. A dropout, dramatic, a loser, ugly, dirty,  probably very selfish and potentially abusive. A liar, vain. If the one hobby that brings me joy turns out to have been tainted, and wasted by my own trashy emo existence, I will kill myself. The last thing that I want to be is an edgy joke.",suicide

I loved and cared my hair for half a year then get it stripped away from me unwillingly.

I have a job that earns me a lot of money, I study mechanical engineering and I'm living together with a very loving and caring girlfriend. It wasn't easy to achieve all of this but I thought if I force myself to put in some energy to make it better I'd actually feel better. But I don't.  I even feel worse.

 I got in my car and drove home with very loud music, like a maniac. Way too fast, ignoring every rule you could possibly think of hoping to crash and die eventually.  I even almost drove off a bridge once and into a wall thrice but changed my mind seconds before the impact every time.

My oldest brother has almost a 20 year age difference on me.

Anyways, I don't know why. It's something I've tried to be vocal about but I find that in modern days those who ""want to help"" are far more fucking annoying than those who will just have a logical conversation with ideas, opinions, facts, thoughts to be shared. 

I'm not going to kill myself this second, nor do I plan on it. But I do often day dream of killing myself, how it'd affect others. And more recently, the past year or so after experimentation with pot, women, and living I really got a new perspective. I was no longer that basement dwelling kid who played video games all day, but instead I'd smoke, bang hot chicks, and have friends. 

Well that's how everyone wants me to live my life, but I don't, and I can't be happy doing what I used to do. I find that more often than not, as of recent, I've wanted to kill myself not for the harm and sadness it'd cause others, but more because I can no longer take others...

I've had thousands of hours of laughs and smiles, and perhaps just as many in the real world as I did the online world.

I don't suppose there's a point to any of this, but I feel like I wanted to just tell somebody. I have a female friend in another state, we've known each other for many years now and I don't know. I want to tell her I love her, but I don't. I don't love her, she likes me a lot, but to me she's the only person I have mentally/intellectually.

I don't know, my point is, I know I don't love the first girl, my friend so I instead went and hugged my mother and told her I loved her, and she gave me a groan and a pissy face unlike normal (normal meaning, the other ~4 times I've gone up to my mom in that manner, hugged her, and told her I loved her in the past year). I know its' just because of her current situation, having to go down to my sisters' house to wash clothes, and my brother getting on her nerves... ugh, I used to love the kid, seriously.

Since my mom died, I've been ready to follow her into the grave. But one morning I realized that my death would leave my sister in a worse position. I've spent months feeling like I'm having a heart attack, blood clot, or any number of deadly conditions. 

None of this matters. Everyone is going to leave. Family is supposed to be there for you forever but they won't be. They'll move on be it through death or any number of instances.

I wish I were never born. I wish I could have chosen if I wanted to exist. It seems pretty fucked up that we don't get a choice. It's a pretty big decision. I wish I had died as a child. I wish I had never seen the things I have.

Everything is boring or stupid. I can't fucking stand people anymore. Their little stupid quips here and there. They all think they're fucking special but they're not. No one is. This planet would be better off is half of us died anyway.

I can't get out of bed before noon, and I can't resist the urge to nap or else lay in bed staring at the walls for hours a day.

We all like to pretend that everything is a-okay. We like to think that ""we're strong as long as we're in this together"" or some bullshit. But you know what? Not a single one of us has some mystical power that makes things okay again. We're all fucking helpless.

I pushed it all down for years. I hid from the emotion and refused to acknowledge the issues. I was nicknamed ""Hitler"" in highschool because shit just rolled off my back. But everything has rolled into the station - full fucking steam ahead.

What am I supposed to do? Just be okay? Pretend that nothing happened? That shit doesn't just go away. There's no fucking magical potion that takes all the memories away - aside from bleach I guess - but memories make the person.

I heard some girls driving along in their fancy car with their family/friends. They had the windows down and were laughing loudly in traffic. I should be happy that someone else can find happiness, but I fucking hate them. I hate that little ignorant bitches can be happy like that. Their stupid high pitched squeals. They think they're so fucking special. But one day, three of the four people in that car will be dead, and one girl will remain. I wonder if things will be better for her. Who knows, they might be worse.

Why can't the planet just explode all at once?

I don't feel close to anyone the way I used to. I don't feel close to my boyfriend or my friend of 13+ years. Or my sister. Though I can identify with her a little more than anyone else.

But when they're around, I can't connect at all. I find myself staring at them, nodding but not really hearing whatever it is they're talking about. I just stare. Sometime I think about how they can be so fucking happy, and other times I just stare.

I find myself staring at people in public too, sometimes hating them and other times not thinking at all.

I feel like I'm eking a little closer to insanity with each passing second. Why do people even try? After everything, we're all going to die anyway. Why does it matter if someone died today or years from now? It's just speeding the inevitable. Life is agony. I live for the next moment I can finally fall asleep again.

Ultimately, I got my job back and got additional work at another workplace after working my arse off. However, I don’t know if I will get my job back the second time around. I’m only a casual worker, not an unsackable boomer in a salaried job who has the luxury of working from home.

I have suffered enough and deserve better for my efforts over the years. If all I have to look forward to is a dystopian police state, then I refuse to live in it.

2488,"I can’t be arsed lnowso I have been suffering with depression for around 10~11 months, well I say that but I believe it to be closer to 5 years but I only want to say what I know and I know that I realised I had depression then. I have never been tested for it because I really don’t want the fuss and besides the medication doesn’t work, my mum was on fluoxetine which is an anti depressant and on the 18 th of february she slit her wrists knowing I was in the house but I have wrote about that before and I do not think I removed it so feel free to read it. I moved from my old school in nottingham to fucking cumbria (and no I am not that prick who is running for the youth council he is just some other guy from nottingham). cumbria is a shithole county full of shitty people who lead shitty lives and have shitty kids to contribute shit all to the shitty society but to be honest I don’t care about that, I just miss having friends irl. I made friends with a really nice girl from florida and we talk almost every day but due to the fact that it’s like 5 hours behind when I want to talk she is usually asleep or at school. I had 4 really good friends on csgo and we often played all through the day and night when I lived in nottingham but now I can’t even talk to them cause I have shit internet which has a data limit cause bt are cunts and don’t have a 6 month contract which we could have taken up for this house (a rental cause our house isn’t even fucking done yet).

I went to my councillor at school once after what happened but that was bullshit and she didn’t help. I didn’t feel comfortable sharing information about what I felt in case I was seen as a risk to myself and got sent to a mad house. I don’t want to go to a mad house cause I am not mad, i fact I believe myself to be the sanest person I know most of the time.

over the past month it seems like my life has been flipped upside down which has made all the shit that wasn’t boxed away in some distant part of my head spill everywhere. This couldn’t have came at a worse time this academic year as I am taking my mock exams for next years GCSE’s and when I am sat in the silent room I can’t stop thinking about what happened, replaying it over and over in my head. I usually do well in exams getting 9’s in science, 8’s in maths and computer science and 7’s in the rest (apart from french because french is the root of pure evil) but in these exams I don’t think I did well. I revised really hard for my maths exam but I don’t think I did well, I am close to being moved down to second set and if I do then I will be average at everything. I am gifted with chemistry and physics, well I assume so due to me getting better then the old A*’s a year early, but I am in a shit set and no teacher will move me. I feel afraid that if I fail these exams I will end up doing something stupid, I was gunna OD on my mums pills but I found out that they don’t work very well so that’s out the window. I just don’t know what to do, I just want everything to be over, I am nice to people and mind my own business and don’t try to be funny and just try to seem like a nice enough person to be friends with but it seems like it doesn’t work but I don’t want to change because then I would become that which I hate, people who try to be funny and seem funny but end up acting like cunts.

I've thought about killing myself a lot of times lately, I know that life is pointless, every human being is just dictated by its conservation and survival instincts as well as their personal pleasure, I know that killing myself would be painless as I know some fast and good methods. I also don't care much about what impact it would have on my friends, family and society as I won't be there to regret anything (I don't believe in gods or afterworlds, to me these are just stuff that humans invented because they couldn't believe that we are pointless and just a complete coincidence)
I was wondering what could I do before I decide to take my final step towards death, I am ready to die anytime, it doesn't matter a lot to me anyway but I'd like to have a little fun before that happens.
I've been watching a lot of anime, playing some video games and making stuff lately, however, I feel like I haven't experienced something that make people want to stay alive longer
I've already kissed a girl but I never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex, I failed my last two trimesters at school, I could get good grades if I worked a lot but I feel like it's not worth it, I feel like if I work hard or not, it won't change anything, I'm still going to die, I just want to have fun, to do what I want but there is no way I could live by doing the things I want.

Today, he got angry with me for making a joke that I’d leave him for Ellen page. He said, as revenge, that he’d leAve me for his ex. As a joke. Then he did his usual of going to bed.

I’m trying so hard to make everybody happy. I’m trying to get through college, I’ve had two abortions I didn’t want because I knew nobody else would appreciate me if I didn’t. Everything I do is to make everybody else happy, and I’m sick of it.

I’m 24, I live with my parents, I’m not able to find a job, and as of ten minutes ago I’m single. I’ve been in college for the past six years, with no luck on enjoying, let alone passing, a course. I’ve had two abortions I didn’t want to have because my boyfriend wanted me to. Throughout the first one, he was constantly telling me to leave him alone. I was constantly depressed for three months after, and he would always tell me to leave if I was going to act like that. The second one, he didn’t do that as much, but I wasn’t as depressed. I guess I was just used to it.

I think I’m ready to leave now. After he said he’d leave me for his ex I just thought... I’ve never thought to joke about that, I’ve never thought of leaving him for my ex, how can he sit there and joke like that if it isn’t true? 

So I think I’m done. I’m done trying. I’ve tried for thirteen years to get better and I’m tired. I can’t handle a job. I can’t handle school. I can’t even handle my boyfriend who I’ve been with for nearly six years.

I told my parents engineering wasn't for me and I went with architecture ( I actually enjoy the drafting part). But not even first semester I'm already falling apart. I felt so depressed and destroyed that I don't know what to tell my family and relatives. 

The only thing that's keeping me alive right now is that it's almost Christmas and I don't want them to have a depressing Christmas Day. Also my mom and dad is in a different country and I never seen them for almost a year. The thought of my family losing me through suicide is something I also can't imagine to think.

Right now I'm only waiting for after Christmas to end my life and a way to do it painlessly. Also probably to talk to some of my friends I never talk to in a little while.",suicide

2576,"Anyone else realize how messed up Timmy Turner’s life was? Looking back, this is quite possibly the saddest show I’ve ever watched. 

His parents were either gone, or not liking him. I.e. their distrust in him when he says Vicky is rude to him. They also regularly make jokes about how much they dislike having had him. His only teacher quite literally was insane. Not only that, this teacher had a profound disliking for Timmy. He’s also bullied in school, both by his “friends” and the person the show actually identifies as a bully. Lastly, the person who does take care of him most of the time, Vicky, is quite possibly a psychopath. 

It gets to the point where he creates a construct in his mind that he has fairies. These fairies can solve every problem Timmy has, it’s everything Timmy has ever *dreamed* of. Sometimes things get so bad, they take him to another world (that fairy world thing) They quite literally blind him from his dark reality, as they bring him to another dimension, make him a superhero, get rid of his bullies, give him a girlfriend, all the things he could *imagine* they brought to him. 

Did you ever think that maybe the reason he can’t show Cosmo and Wanda to other people, isn’t because they would be taken away, but because they don’t exist? Think about it, his parents, his teacher, everyone constantly gives him weird looks, treats him like he’s lost it, treats him like he’s a “not all there” 5 year old. Maybe the reason the teacher hates fairies so much, isn’t because he just doesn’t like them, but because the “fairies” Timmy is always talking to are the sole reason he doesn’t try in school. 

Toward the end of the show, his parents get him a dog. Now, if you’re the parent to a 13 year old you’re not just going to give them a dog that they need to take care of all on their own. You’d only get them a dog if the child ABSOLUTELY needs it. In Timmy’s case, the dog is likely just a therapy dog, who the parents got for Timmy thinking it could help him return to reality.

2580,"How can I get over other people's opinion ? The only thing that keeps me from committing suicide is others' opinion about me !I want to commit suicide for various reasons:
 
  1. I'm in Medical school which I hate. Do not tell me ""it's going to get better"" - It won't ( and either way, I've run out of patience to wait for it ). Do not tell me ""you can choose something else"" - I can't, I invested time and energy into this and I am no good at anything else ( and I'm not brilliant at this either, so fuck it ). 

  2. I had an arguing with my parents. I know damn well that being 23 years old and living with them is a shame, but they just make me to feel even worse about it, even though they know I can't move out, because I have no money. Yeah, I could take out a loan and then spend the rest of my life working like a mad horse to pay back the loan. Thanks,  but no thanks. If this is life, I'd rather be dead and end up in I don't-give-a-fuck-where, whether hell does exist or not, I just don't give a damn, this crap is not worth living. 

  3. I didn't have a great adolescence at all. The first part of it was spend being a perfectionist, emotionally liable pathetic creature that I was, struggling to do well in school, because this was the only thing that mattered to my mom, plus struggling with my eating disorders all the time. The second part of it was me rebelling against my fucked-up family life: abusing alcohol and hanging out with other fucked-up people like me. Fast-forward and I'm 23, being in Medical school, studying things that I don't like, which is not a surprise, because for whatever reason I can't enjoy anything in my life at all anymore ( probably my brain is already fucked because of years of abuse ). 

  So there it is: I don't want to be a burden for my parents anymore and I can't think of anything else to figure out the shit I'm in and I've tried a lot of things. I tried working out, I was a gym member for 4 fucking years, you know what I got ? Even more body-image issues. 

  Also there is nothing motivating about the future either: in this world it's all about making good connections and licking people's asses, this is how you get ahead and so what's the point of it ? What's the point of this whole life , if I don't like anything at all about it anymore ?  I don't like the way things work, I don't like how this whole fucking world works, and because I know I'm not going to be the one who is going to change the world, I might just as well check-out, because I really don't want to fit in this society.

  I want to commit suicide, I just don't want to think about what other people will think after I die. It's kind of ironic, but this is the only thing that is holding me back. These idiots are going to talk about me even after I'm dead and I can't stand the idea of it. So tell me, if you are an average, normal person: how much people gossip about someone after they die ? What things they say about them ? Do they consider them cowards ? ",suicide

I’ve had several more failed attempts. It’s not that I want to die but it feels right to me.

I don’t know why I’m feeling like this and it’s a little off putting. I can look at my kid hold or touch him. I always have to tell him everything will be okay when I know it may not be. I have it all planned and ready to go. I have lost everyone who was close to me and I try to reach out but everyone is just annoyed with me trying to vent. I am ready for everything to be over. I don’t want to leave my son fatherless but I know I am replaceable. I can’t tell his mom because I want to treasure the moments I have left with him. I’m only 25 but I know I won’t make it past 30.

I'll just quickly say that I developed social phobia in the 7th grade. Since I shied away from everyone, I had no friends (besides my brother's friends who were only my friends because of my brother) all the way through high school. I get to college and run into the same problems. I never admitted it to myself until recently, but I've had severe depression/apathy for a very long time.

I no longer have social phobia, but I can't bring myself to show my personality. I've shown less and less of my personality as the years have gone by to the point that I'm now a complete fucking weirdo. And this isn't just around strangers and acquaintances I'm talking about; this is around my own brother and my cousin who is basically my sister. I can't be myself or show myself to anyone. I've recently tried 'practicing' by myself and trying to figure who I fucking am anymore and I don't like what I see and hear.

I took shrooms about two weeks ago and now instead of bottling everything away in pure apathy, I now care like a normal person. And I just want to die...even though I of course don't actually want to die. I want to be happy and comfortable being myself around people, but since I can't do that and will never be able, I want to die.

And I'm freaking out. I constantly have this terrible feeling in my stomach like I'm about to give a speech to a crowd of over 1000 people (and just giving a short presentation in class is one of my least favorite things in the world)... and it won't go away.

To be honest, I wasn't there for 12 years and we recently reconnected and have been talking on Facebook.

A friend talked me out of it once, but I'm too awkward and cowardly to admit to him that I'm not fine this time. I don't want to drop hints because I consider it attention whoring. I mean, if others do it, that's okay. They deserve help.



If anyone asked me what was wrong months ago, I would have had a ton of reasons to wish it, but didn't want to do it. Now I have no reason to wish it, but I want it more than ever.

2630,"Never happyI used to be so happy when I was a child in school. My imagination was so big that I forgot everything else along with my bestfriend during that time. But time changed as I got older... I woke up when I was around 12 years old. It was all about girls, education and success all of sudden and I didnt understand it. I began feeling unhappy and have been it ever since. Im 21 btw. I was always the ""clown"" who made all my friends laugh and I laughed myself on the outside. But inside I was crying... I felt alone and unhappy. I had friends and a bestfriend yes. But I was still completely alone once I walked home to my house playing video games. When I got older I began loosing my friends and became more an outsider in my school. They invited me to parties but I began making lies to skip it and so I spend so many weekends alone.  *I have missed out on so many epic parties,* I have missed out so many epic parties and experiences because of my shyness and lies. As I went to highschool it got worse. I only saw my classmates in school and to a few parties. I was still the funny guy though but that was all. During senior some in my class begin making fun of me for never having talked to a girl before. I just laughed with them. But deep inside it was another knife to my heart of all the failures I have made. I realised I will never get to experience what my friends experienced. The normal social life, always spending time with the guys, going out and hooking girls. After I graduated I lost all contact with them cuz I skipped them. Im an selfish asshole and that have destroyed my life.

Now I am on the edge of suicide. I dont fit in this world. I make jokes of everything and make people laugh. But the only person who doesnt laugh is myself. Where is the joy? Where is my succes? Where is my happiness?  

But I have accepted reality and find that hope was only a peaceful illusion.... Now acceptance, still lost and no idea where next... Am I happy? Never. That's just another illusion, I'm conscious of reality....for now, that's enough but not for long..... ",suicide
2631,"Constantly feeling stressed, suicidal, and anxiety-ridden. I'VE HAD ENOUGH, SOMEONE FUCKING STOP THIS.So, this is probably going to turn into a wall of text but I'll try to keep this short and sweet.

I guess this started about a year ago when I had my first panic attack at 16. It was horrible, and I've never really recover from that and I've been constantly in a downwards spiral. My anxiety is constant throughout the day, for all that time, never truly giving me a break. Sometimes its manageable when I'm in the my room during the daytime, but anywhere else it's a fucking painful cancer. Even things like movies and themeparks make me want to cry and puke from anxiety. Sometimes I get lucky and I get a couple minutes burst of endorphins, but those are quick and only put the anxiety in the background. Everything is just so difficult to do now.

This anxiety has caused worse and worse mental health. My memory and focus is completely shot because I can't sleep at night (typing this at 3 A.m). I can't even get to sleep unless there's sunlight coming in, causing me to be in a vicious cycle of sleeping from 4 A.M to 12 P.M. I've tried so much to get me back to normal but my body simply will not cooperate. If I go to bed at 9 P.M I'll wake up a hour later in a sweat and bursting with energy I can't use.. It's exhausting and I had it. I just want to have a normal sleeping pattern of 11 P.M- 8 A.M.

My appetite is out of control. I'm not hungry during the day and starving during the night. I hate it so fucking much. 

Over the past six months self-harm and suicidal thoughts are becoming worse. My day is bombarded with thoughts of hanging myself, throwing myself down the stairs, and chocking myself out. Now sometimes when I close my eyes I see a grotesque image. I'ts becoming more and more frequent.

I don't have any friends and I'm going insane from that. My parents are completely emotionally unavailable and useless. Every time I bring it up, I get stepped on ignored. They constantly keeping me on a leash, refusing to let me out of the house until they so decree. I don't even have a single fucking friend. How the hell does a fucking teenager now have any friend how the hell could some be that stupid jesus fucking christ. My only grace is I found a job and can get out of the house part-time. There's nobody around to help.

This is causing me so many problems. Every day feels exhausting and terrifying. Nothing feels real anymore. My emotions and thoughts are clashing like waves. My brain just won't fucking stop being so mean. I'm woozy and faintish whenever I stand up. I don't have motivation to game or write anymore, which I used to love. Everything just hurts me now.

I honestly just want to die and get this the hell over with, I just want rest. I just want everything to stop. I'm so fucking honestly and helpless and so far gone I don't know I would even want to live if I got better. This has been the worst year and my fucking life and hopefully the last. ",suicide

My parents say if I prepare myself it'll be fine, but it never is. And it really hasn't been since around 5th grade. For about 5 years my social life has just been crumbling and I've slipped further and further into introversion and depressive thoughts as social anxiety grew. I know I shouldn't, but I hate myself for it. I hate myself for being so awkward around people. I hate being at school as it reminds me of how much I am pathetic at social interactions. Three more years of high school is daunting. What's after that... is terrifying. I swear, the only thing keeping me from completely losing my shit is music and reddit.

2647,"Am I alone in feeling this way?Hi all. I joined reddit only to come here and reach out. I feel pretty lonely and I really just want to know if there are other people that have a similar experience. I am not actively suicidal or in danger to myself, but I've been struggling a lot. 

I'm a teenager, and it's been six weeks since I got discharged from a residential treatment program, and I've been having a really hard time. I've never had a ""real"" suicide attempt, but I've been depressed and anxious for a long time, and I've lived with suicidal ideation since I was 10. My family has been abusive in the past. I didn't realize this was the case until very late into my treatment at residential which has been very difficult because I came home with a lot of unresolved issues. 

I've been in every level of care, and because I was steadily declining, I was put into a residential treatment facility. I also needed 24 hour care due to how nonfunctional I was. When I got there I realized that most of my peers in the facility had attempted suicide. I have had suicidal actions, such as writing letters/notes, collecting pills, figuring out ways to end my life, starting to attempt, etc. Ever since I got into treatment, my resolve to actually attempt has gotten stronger and stronger. I'm very afraid that my pain isn't valid unless I've tried to kill myself. That narrative has been cycling through my mind for a few years, and now I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it. 

There have been many, many times when I've been actively suicidal, or at least gotten to being ""truly suicidal"", meaning I really, really wanted to die. As in, that's all I wanted out of life. When I was residential I really wanted to kill myself and I tried 3 times, but none of them worked because I didn't have what I actually wanted to use, which was really frustrating at the time.

 The other odd thing I've realized is that I wasn't attempting outside of treatment because I lived by staying in bed all day, sleeping all day, or watching youtube all day. That meant I didn't have to actually think about why I was in pain, so I stayed in limbo of numbing the pain and constantly getting caught in it. I guess it was my only way of keeping my suffering at bay. But then when I actually had to think about the pain or why I was in pain, the suicidal thoughts became rampant. It also doesn't help that when I'm not suicidal or when I'm having a good day, that ""I'm not sick enough"" narrative is there. So when I'm actually actively suicidal where I want to die, that narrative adds even more resolve as to why I ""need"" to kill myself. 

But I'm afraid of being seen as wanting attention. That's the exact opposite of what I want. It's really hard to attempt at home because 1) I don't want my family to know 2) I don't want people to find out and worry 3) I don't want to get hospitalized again 4) I don't want to talk about with anyone, or talk about the emotions behind it. 

It's weird, because when I'm not actually suicidal, I'm thinking all the time about wanting to attempt suicide to prove I'm in pain, or that my pain is valid. But when I'm actually suicidal where I want to die to end the pain, then the ""you need to prove it"" just feels like an added reinforcer, even if that's not the primary reason I want to die. But then again, isn't it kind of fucked up that my baseline is ""I need to prove I'm in pain by risking my life and/or dying""?

I don't know, maybe I'm looking for reassurance, maybe I'm looking for someone to relate. It's odd. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this, and I haven't, so I'm still trying. I'm still reaching out. But it's just so hard.

I think I'm just sad and alone and exhausted.",suicide

2655,"Irreversible problemIn general I've had an alright life. I've got friends, I'm generally liked by those who take the time to get to know me, I have a supportive mother and family, I became successful in a career I wanted to pursue from just my own enthusiasm, fincally alright off and I had a loving, caring and stunningly beautiful girlfriend who I shared so much in common and wanted to spend my life with, as did she.

Everything changed when my girlfriend took her life.

During our two year relationship she'd been suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder, I tried to get her support and help and in ways she seemed to be getting better.
The problems certainly put a strain on our relationship and left me emotionally and mentally exhausted at times, but I stuck by her because she was worth it. 

Among the many reasons she may have taken her life I know she was very scared about me being away for a new contract as I'd been gone for the weekdays and even with me trying to reassure her I believe her abandonment issues overwhelmed her. 

Since it happened everything has just spiralled. Her mother blamed me and started to spread lies about me resulting in people turning against me. It's put immense strain on my relationship with my mother as she witnesses me lose my will to live. I had to leave the job as I could no longer face it and lost all passion for the career I once enjoyed so much.

The main thing above all else is how I've lost her and I can't fathom or face a life without her. She was just too special, too loving, too beautiful and no one will ever live up to her. I feel like I failed her by moving away and none of this would've happened had I just stayed.

I'm 32, I've spent most of my adult life single due to my crippling shyness and anxeity. It was almost a mircale that a girl like her was interested in a guy like me and I feel in ways I blew it for not making her feel more special and taking her for granted.

It's been over half a year since it happened and I'm just getting worse. Even with therapy, grief counselling, medication and endless research I'm not improving. I won't meet another and even if somehow I did they would never compare. 

I don't really want to die but again, I can't face a reality without her. I find myself spending more time now just getting ready to end it, getting the confidence to do it. I get no joy from anything, I just cry and spend all day in bed. Not even sure why posting this, I guess it's just somewhere to vent. ",suicide

A lady there during orientation said her “heart goes out to suicide ideation patients because y’all there are some people that don’t think their life is worth living and that just hurts my heart for them” and my (internal) reaction being such a person without her realizing was “b— no one said your life was worth living either. I could have literally any life and I would still want to die.” Basically my point is pity is not helpful because we are not less than you. 
Aside from that it really sucks but it’s true even though my specific life is extremely difficult and hard to deal with I cannot imagine any possible life where I would be okay apart from maybe just inheriting a couple million dollars. (Not going to happen any time soon.) 
I can’t think of any job where I would be okay or any way of life where I would be okay.

Tried to find a doctor but they said it will be at least a week and a half for my first app with a therapist and two weeks after that to see a psychiatrist. I don’t have a regular doctor and all the local doctors charge a $120 new patient fee on top of the appointment itself.   My husband says he will take me to commit myself tomorrow but my hospital triggers the anxiety and it’s the only good hospital there is so everything just suck and knowing from the backside they are just pitying me doesn’t help.

care.Note: I have been in a depression for a long time. Opened up about it about a year ago. Saw almost all of my friends leave me, one by one when I wasn't useful anymore. I lost my job, got expelled from university for failing to write my final thesis and had to move back to my parents basement. I had one friend left, my best friend, or so I thought. She didn't stay in contact and neither did I much. I wrote two e-mails but that's that. I had hoped she'd care about me even when I wasn't around to do things for her. She didn't. When I hadn't heard from her in two months I wrote to her wishing her well for the future. I thought that it had ended and wanted to at least tell her that I am proud of her for having finished university and all. She replied that she had put her head in the sand instead of writing me and she was sorry. And then she asked if I had my degree and what I was doing now. And I...well...I kinda broke. I told her that I hadn't gotten my degree because, as I told her, I was kicked out. And that quite frankly I have nothing ""exciting to share"" because I was trying not to kill myself and it was pretty hard. I also replied that I knew that I didn't have much to offer in terms of conversations and that it was okay if she didn't want to reply.

And well she didn't. I don't know, I was probably too harsh to her and there is nothing she can do anyway. I am just a burden for everyone and why would she want to talk to me? It's just hard knowing that apart from your parents there isn't a single person who cares. I guess I am wondering if I should try to apologize, get her a present and ask her to forgive me because I really really owe it to my parents not to kill myself and it's just harder when you have no social network at all.

He died of liver cancer on the hours between 11pm of Feb 12 and 1am Feb 13, I was woken up by my worried girlfriend (we were  in a call and was woken up by the same thing) and my mother screaming and pleading for mercy
I didn't have a chance to see my father when he was hospitalized up until the day of his death, mere hours before it happened. He was drugged, only way through stop his unrelenting rebellious spirit that prevented him from staying in bed. Only thing I could get to say was that I had finally entered into law school, his dream come true, he was so happy. He wanted to kiss me, but he couldn't, he was too high. I kissed him instead, and begged him to stay still. I promised him I'd tell him more once he was out of the hospital. He replied to me with a particular set of words in Spanish he would always say to me ""ok, Mijo"" high and not willing to let me go but still letting me go because he understood I was uncomfortable. How I wish I hadn't.
How I wish he was still alive, still with me, still smiling and talking to me about his job in the private air charter flights company he administrated
Life without him is so hard, it's almost not worth living

Almost.
I still cling onto my now ex girlfriend. She has BPD, and I myself am not at my 100% sanity levels. She still loves me, so she claims. But during two months past my father's death, I treated her badly. I would be cold and edgy, saying things like nothing mattered in the end not even her, seeking help from anyone and anything that'd be willing to help me feel better, this worsened our situation, and long story short, we broke up. After nearly a year of full commitment, and 7 months of nothing but what we both wanted, a relationship 100% us and no one else, we broke up. I hurt her to the point where her entire body and life tells her not to come back to me. She keeps saying she wants to be better and healthier before we date again, as she also has cancer. A little detail I didn't mention before, that holds some importance. I always tried my best to take care of her as much as I could, even in her darkest times. It seems as though it's an excuse to gwork on herself and become independent and forget about me though. I'm soon to be diagnosed with ADHD as my therapist said I met all criteria but prefered I went to a psychiatrist for a Dx. So maybe that plays a part in the way I see things, and I sure hope it is
But then again
Sometimes she'll come to me and give me all that love, and sometimes it just seems as though she's tired of even talking to me. 
My mother and other family members know me as the smart yet extremely quite kid. Not to make a joke and a stereotype about autism but, you know the kind. They expect so much from me, but I'm failing class, I'm failing my father, I failed to take care of him. My actions got him killed. I could've saved him.
My actions also ended a relationship both parties had invested tons into, and now I cling onto the idea that we will one day be back together, even though sometimes it seems like a straight off lie. But I've lost so much already, I've destroyed my entire life.
If she confirms my doubts and leaves, nothing will stop me from wanting to od, no matter how many things are pointed out, people that love me, things like that. Nothing works, I simply want out, and I don't know why I can't just feel okay again, this year has taken everything from me; even my will to live.",suicide

My Me Mission Services LLC has always been a very personal company that helped individuals one-on-one to improve their lives. Lately, we've decided to open a blog in order to reach and help people on a much more grand scale.

Suicidal thoughts is a real problem that many people face. Over the last two years, we've helped dozens of suicidal men and women improve their lives and reduce their suicidal tendencies.

A huge component of the mentality of many suicidal people is the feeling that they are alone. Many feel that the problems they're dealing with are unique when most are very common. In order to show this, we would like to interview (formerly) suicidal men and women and share their stories in the Stories section of our blog. We not only want to help people know that they are not alone, we want to share real world examples of how others in their situation have curved those thoughts and improved their lives.

You can choose to make your identity confidential in the way you want. If you're in Las Vegas, we can interview you in person and you have the option to have your video interview posted.

Just send me a DM/PM and we can set something up.

Some people like me and call me their friend. I don’t know if their standards are super low or what, but I wish I had the heart to tell them how much I appreciate the fact they like me. I wish they would ignore me and go for better friends but at the same time, it feels like a knife going through my chest when I see them talk to other people, as if I’m selfish and need approval, even if it won’t do much.

I get jealous when I see the men around me. They’re confident and responsible. I was beaten a lot by my uncles as a kid. I can tell one of them feels remorse over his actions since he’s been too nice over the years, trying to buy me expensive things and whatever. 

The abuse ripped apart every inch of manhood I had. I wasn’t strong, I wasn’t dignified and I wasn’t brave. I’ve bonded more with my sisters than any other men I’ve met in my life. They understood the abuse as they had gone through it as well, however they could be a bit stoic at times. 

Because of the abuse, I’ve grown to not trust many people and be extremely anxious and shy 24/7. I hear my family members, schoolmates, etc talk about how I lack ambition, how I’m too reserved and feminine, how I’m not as good as the other kids. Sorry I can’t speak in a room full of people, sorry if my face flushes red when my name is called, sorry I feel more comfortable being alone for days than visiting some of the family but it’s your fault for sitting back there and supporting the abuse when I was younger. Every time I took one step too far, I’d be threatened as you thought it was a good way to control me.

My father died when I was 4 and I was vulnerable. Beating and threatening me with violence are the two things you should definitely not be doing... All those punches that were thrown, tears I’ve shedded and lashes from your belts were for no benefit. And even then, my father probably wouldn’t have treated me any nicer had he still been alive at that point. 

I’m the runt of the family now. I’m stupid, weak, shy and not manly enough. Why can’t I be more like my fucking doctor aunts or lawyer uncles?! I’d kill myself if I didn’t have two sisters and a few friends who care. I’m happy for my sisters, but their success still hurts...

I needed some time to think about if I was ready to just back in to a relationship and took 4 days to think. During that time the girl got into another relationship.

She was seeing somebody else but kissed me before I told her I needed some time. Then she never told me she was in a relationship and let me believe I was taking her out on a date over the weekend. It was only after I had kissed her that she told me she had a boyfriend. Despite that we went out for dinner and she held my hand and cuddled into my arm, crying a lot because she wants to be with me but she says 'she can't'. I took her home and she begged me to stay the night, to which I responded that it wouldn't be right. She told me 'we don't have to do anything, we can just cuddle', which to me implied she wanted more to happen. I wanted more to happen too but I left because I knew it would've hurt more if we slept together and she still couldn't be with me.

Everyday I wish I wasn’t present in this world; feeling, thinking... but I will never kill myself because I have an extreme fear of death (Thanatophobia). I was brought up atheist so I never had an afterlife concept, no hell or heaven, just darkness. I think it was this that caused me to have a fear of death from a young age. I used to have panic attacks thinking about death at the ages of 9-10. This never went away and I carried it to my adulthood as well. Thanatophobia is not only causing me to stay alive, but it is also feeding my depression. I simply cannot make peace with the knowledge of all will come to an end someday. And I will not be the one to determine which day that will be. So, this is not hopeful, this is not positive.

I'm not working since I graduated from college. I need money. I can't live like this forever. I have to communicate with those people. I have to work with them. even this idea scares me, not like social phobia or something else, I just don't want to do it. it always surprises me that how I graduated from those schools without any nervous breakdown. except the fake friends, I was always alone and I can say that my most beautiful years gone wasted, and it was just because of this two faced society. they were/they are hypocrite and abusive every topic you can imagine.

2762,"I have lost my desire to live and want to dieHello, I'm not sure where to start, but I am just going to start typing to put the thoughts in my head down in some sort of unorganized manner.  I apologize in advance for my poor grammar and scattered thought process.  I'm currently drunk while typing this after finding out my ex has moved on to another person.  I'm watching football, and that used to make me very happy. I don't care about it today. I'm severely depressed. I don't want to be alive any longer. The only things that keep me going are the fact that I have a wonderful dog who would be devastated and without a home if I passed away, and my mom would be devastated if I passed away.  

I have no job, no potential employment, about $15,000 in student loan debt, a $223 per month car payment, I'm expected to pay $890 at the end of the month for rent, I no longer have health insurance, and I don't have enough to cover those bills in the bank. My ex-girlfriend who was an absolute gift in my life that I never deserved left me a few months ago due to my chronic abuse of marijuana and alcohol on a daily basis, and I am completely unable to get over it. I dream about her a couple times a week, and while I'm awake, the poor decisions that I made while we were in a relationship are daily reminders to me about how shitty of a person I am.  When I dream about her, we are happy, but when I wake up, reality hits me and I'm sad when I wake up almost every morning/afternoon.  She was wonderful and treated me more kindly than any other person I've known.  On top of that, she is absolutely beautiful from head to toe and inside out. She's the only woman I've ever met that doesn't compromise her morals for other people or situations.  I became too much of a burden on her life, and she left me when she went to study abroad in September of this year.  

I've been thinking about killing myself for years, and I don't own a firearm for the fear that I would use it on myself in a moment of complete depression and sadness. 

Since I was a child I was told that I had ADHD, and I was put on a regiment of Ritalin, Concerta, or Adderall (sorry if they are spelled wrong), and I think that's what began my addictive lifestyle. I have quit smoking, but I drink at least 5 days a week. When I'm not drinking, I often think about drinking. I'm unorganized, have months of mail that deals with bills and unpaid taxes and such.  I'm messy and don't know where to start to fix things, so I just ignore them.  My mother is a hoarder, and many of those tendencies have become my own as I grow older.  I hate that about me. I hate most things about me. I often find myself wishing that I had cancer or some debilitating disease so that I have an excuse as to why I feel as hopeless and sad as I do. I keep everything hidden from my family and friends. I justify it by telling myself that I don't want to be a reason for them to be unhappy. I would much rather see and make them happy than bring them down with the problems that plague my mind on a daily basis.  

As far as the things that make me happy go, they are few.  I have recently begun coaching volleyball for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. I'm not fully qualified yet, so I don't get paid, but coaching is an absolute joy for me. When I coach, all my problems melt away and I'm focused on the issues at hand which are teaching the girls on how to be better at volleyball.  I currently help out an elderly gentleman with his teams because I'm 27 and able to do much more than he is when it comes to the physical demands of coaching.  I am in the process of becoming a qualified coach, but I'm dragging my feet, so to speak, for some reason.  

Today I am thinking about ending my life more than any other.  I have already chosen the place that I would like to do it so as to decrease the shock upon people and family as much as possible.  I have already begun writing the letters and thinking out what I want to say to the people who would be directly affected by my abrupt death.  This post is quite possibly my last outcry to try and save my life.  I have lost every desire to even wake up in the morning. I'm am bombarded and reminded of my problems from financial to emotional as soon as I wake up each day, so that makes me not want to wake up anymore.  

On a daily, and sometimes hourly basis, I remind myself of how much of a loser/failure I am. I have had so many opportunities for further education and employment pass me by, and I feel like there isn't much hope left for me.  I can't make enough money to pay my bills even when I do become a fully qualified volleyball coach so that I can be paid.  I no longer desire to be happy because after my somewhat momentary happiness ends there is always the crippling reminder by my mind of the actual situation that I find myself in.  

I appreciate anyone who reads this as my last outcry to salvage any type of productive/happy life that I might have.  If you can't make a difference in my life, I don't blame you. Most likely I will be dead in a few weeks once the New Years rolls around.  That's my plan at least. 

I view myself as completely undesirable and unwanted from birth to adulthood. I am largely a burden from financial reasons to emotional reasons to the people/family that are involved in my life. 

I could use some help. I want to die, but I want to live at the same time. Life is hard, and I don't know how to function properly as an adult.  If you are reading this for the first time in 2017, then just ignore it because i am most likely already dead.  

Thank you to anyone who has spent their time reading this rambling of thoughts and emotions.  I hope you have a happier life than I have and make more constructive decisions than I have.  I don't believe in God, so I have no hope for the afterlife.  I may fall sleep soon. I've had about 6 shots of vodka since I began writing this.

Thank you, and I'm sorry to burden your life with my problems.   ",suicide

Buddy B doesn't even like hip hop, I do and live 10 minutes away from buddy A but they like each other. I don't have that with anyone.

""Get hobbies"" I have multiple social and socialish hobbies

""volunteer"" I have done in the past but with my hobbies, university and work I don't have time at the moment

It doesn't make a difference because I'm still the same boring old me no matter where I go.

I've been to social skills classes, I've tried to invite people out only to receive silence or rejection. I've read book after book and watched Ted talk after Ted talk. I suck at conversations, thinking of things to say. I'm probably an energy drain without realising it. I don't want to wait for ""ThE OnE"" in a romantic sense. I'm lonely and don't want to live like this anymore. What's the point of working hard for money and then Is suicide only a depression thing? Why can't it be a logical choice?

Maybe I'm a damn alien I can't connect with people. Even when I think I've clicked with a person it means nothing to them.

Maybe people can smell desperation but i don't know what else to do. I'm normally one to try to fix an issue instead of complain but I'm done.  I want to spend time with people. I'll probably end it after university so I wouldn't have failed college twice. I want to at least get a 1st/A, go out on a high. ",suicide

I am 24-year-old introvert guy, who has emigrated to Australia recently. I am kinda introvert and have some can be considered as close friends. I have gone through a lot of things, including working in many underpaid jobs just to support my life here and finally got my permanent residency. I was so proud of that, even more when i got a job as accountant in a small accounting firm. However like they said ""the higher you climb, the harder you fall"", when i lost my job recently since my company was undergoing some major changes in their structure and there would be no more work that i could do, i am feeling so depressed and can't help the thought of being incompetent to keep the job. I've been trying to apply for another jobs but receive just rejection letters so far. Today it is even worse when my manager in my current underpaid part time job (where i've been working for nearly 3 years) said she was pissed when seeing me working so slow and wanted to fire me but would give me another two weeks to see how i would do. It was a huge shock since I didn't know what was just going on.
My career is just in no where and even a underpaid labour job that I couldn't keep. I don't know how incompetent i can be.
 Now i am in a place far away from home, can't talk to my family since I don't want them to worry sick about me and can't talk to my friends since they have too much to worry already.

2789,"I just want to ventI've been depressed my whole life, and became suicidal 2 years ago. I've tried one shoddy attempt at suffocating myself once with a plastic bag and rope, but that was it so far. I do fantasize about it all the time, daily, even as I type this. I tried to talk to my dad about it  several times, but he thinks its just bullshit. I talked to my sister about it a lot, but she always seemed to just brush it off because  she went through a depressive streak and slashed her wrists, but got over it somehow. 


She went and had a kid with an abusive drug addicted criminal, and now she is going through a nasty custody battle with him. I am being supportive, listening to her, being understanding, reassuring her, basically just trying to help her out as best as I can, and not stress her out. I also help her pay for some minor things and help babysit my nephew, as well go to court with her to give her a moral boost. She moved back in with me and our abusive parents, and I tried my damn hardest to make sure they focused most of their crap on me instead of her. She was only able to last a month with them. 


So we go to court last week, nothing really happens but the crazy guy's lawyer scares the shit out of my sister, so she calls me hysterically crying saying she wants kill herself. I somehow manage to calm her down and cheer her up pretty quickly, we talk some more, and she hangs up. And now here is the problem, ever since that phone call I get extremely angry when I get my suicidal thoughts. It's like those thoughts have been a comforting thing for me, something I could control. When now I can't think about them, because if I go and off myself my sister and nephew will have no one to help them. Anyone have any advice? This shit makes my angry just typing it.

2794,"Today was one of the greatest days of my life so far. So this year overall sucks. We can agree on that. Me personally I started having a rough year. In January I managed to tear my ACL and meniscus, then COVID hit so even when I could walk again I couldn’t do anything because of the lockdown. My drivers test got postponed and I couldn’t get out of a deep emotional rut for a while. 
Around June however things were looking up. I had completed PT at this point and was able to go lifting again, I took my drivers test, passed and got a job the next day. I bought the truck I have now and have been working on it and making it a great vehicle, I’m doing decently in school and have made a lot of friends through work. (I was always an introvert and with my job I’m meeting people that I enjoy hanging with) this eventually led to me being invited to my first Halloween party in close to 10 years and just overall being a happier person.
My dad asked me if I wanted to meet for dinner after work, I said yes and met him at a restaurant near where I work. (Just so y’all know there are no family issues we just don’t see eachother a lot because of work schedules.) after a bit of talking he says how proud he is of me and all the accomplishments I’ve made this year thus far, and how proud of a dad he is. 

I’m so happy right now and I’m so happy my life is taking suck a wonderful turn around!

I don't really know where to start, or what I'm doing, but here I go.

I'm very shy and private-I think I always have been- and I don't ever feel really comfortable talking to people I'm not really familiar with. Even online, I'm pretty much always a lurker. As a result, I only have a handful of people I feel like I can go to when I'm feeling depressed. And I just feel like I bring the people I love down all the time. I'm so needy but I have nothing to offer. I'm like a child and I don't understand why I even have the few friends I do.

My dog is dying. He has a cancerous lump that's enormous, and has been growing for about a year and a half now. I know not everyone will understand, and I'm not trying to equate this with losing a human being, but losing my dog is really, really hard. He's been my constant friend since I was 3 years old (I'm 19 now), he moved with me from one country to another, and he's always been so gentle and sweet. I know he'll be gone soon and I'm trying so hard to prepare myself but today on the train I finally just started crying. I imagined what it would be like never to get to hug him again and it was torture. I'm away from home right now so I'm sitting here in my dorm hugging my stuffed animal like an infant pretending its him.

On top of it, my anxiety has gotten out of control. I've always had it but I think college has made it much, much worse. I'm very rarely cheerful. I'm happiest when I imagine what I want my future to be like. Silly things like pretending I'm best friends with Quentin Tarantino or that I write for the Daily Show. I feel like my imagination has been able to sustain me for 19 years but I'm old enough now to realize those things will probably never happen, and right now I don't feel like I have anything that makes me as happy as my stupid Mary Sue dreams that wont ever come true.

I used to want to be a writer but more and more I feel like I have nothing to say, and no motivation to try. Ironically, I really want to write comedy, because it's the stuff that's always made me happiest, but I just don't think I have the ability to make others as happy as comedy has made me. So even watching things that used to make me laugh feels painful.

There's so many things I want to do, but more and more I'm realizing I'm not nearly as special as I wish I were. Aside from being a good comfort to my mom (she's been depressed since her best friend of 36 years died a few years back) there's nothing I feel like I can do. I used to dream so big and for the past few years I've been forced to come to terms with how small I really am. And I just don't see the point of living for probably decades more if I'll never be as happy as I was when I was, like, 5 years old and going to Disney for the first time. I just don't think I'm cut out for it.

I'm sorry this is so long, and I don't really know what I want from this, I just felt the need to write something. I don't want to bother my friends anymore.",suicide

I don't even know where to start, but right now, things are really bad - or feel really bad at least. I'm aware that a lot of it has to do with how I experience it and I think this might make it worse. 

Right now, I have a week off annual leave that I've been looking forward to for months. But now we're in full lockdown again and even though I don't want to go outside (thanks to OCD), it just frustrates me that I don't really have too many options - no cinema, no restaurant visits... I understand it's necessary, but it's still hard. 

I have no family or friends nearby either. Just housemates that I don't get along with very well. Or rather, that I don't really want to talk to as that would drag me down even more.

I have a therapist, but I feel that the quality of therapy just gets worse and worse, we don't really resolve anything, we just chat. Which is nice, in a way, but it doesn't really help in the long run. She told me to contact her whenever I need to get something off my chest, but she doesn't really reply to it anymore, which kind of defies the purpose. 
I know that most therapists probably wouldn't be available 24/7, and that's understandable - but I do miss those replies she used to send, a short text or voice message, sometimes giving advice or even just to acknowledge it. 

She pretty much is the only person I can talk to. My family would just tell me to get my stuff together. 

I do have a best friend, but she seems very distant recently too. Maybe it's the situation as a whole, maybe some external factor, maybe I'm just such a pain? I can't even ask that as I'd be worried she would just sugarcoat  the answer (Or start to feel annoyed if I keep asking why she's so distant/if she still wants to go on holidays once it's safe to do so).

I think the only reason I'm still here is that I know deep inside that I mean... at least something to some people. Probably not as much as I wish I would, but that's something I only have so much control over. I try my best, but I can't tell what other people are thinking. 
(Well. And because I just got that off my chest)

Alright. Thank you for reading!
If you have any advice or just some encouraging words, feel free to reply.

Have a lovely day!",suicide
2829,Wonder when they'll find my bodyI'm tired of being a fraction of a person. I dont remember anything anymore and I cant put a full sentence together in my head anymore. My friends used to try to remind me of things wed done together or times we had shared but those memories and the capability to feel something on that level again are permanently gone. I dont remember who I was. I've wanted to die for nearly 20 years. I'm almost 30.  There is no future for me I wish my friends and family would accept that and let me die. I dont feel anything towards them. I dont remember what it felt like to love them or be loved by them and doubtful I ever will again.,suicide

Short progolgue/rant/explanation before going into the problem: It is not my first time writting here but I will try to be short as possible since I had a really bad and am not in the mood for writting. Just to let you know that I am a woman and to give you perspective since most advices here are by men for men and it is very easy to throw around some words when it is all men. Like men have it easier because if they go to the fitness and make big muscles, half of my problems that I have as a woman will be eradicated but I as a woman can't go out there looking like a tall manly monster while men can go away with it. 

I am aware this question must have been asked a lot in the past but what I see is only advice for men, like to ""man up"" and to certain things but I do not have money or resources to do most of them so if you are a man and give me advice give it with a grain salt, knowing that I do not live in America, but in Europe, I am a woman so I can't ""grow balls"" or ""beat up everyone I want to for fun"" or ""walk around freely with a knife or a gun"" like it was suggested in some other thread I saw 

P.S. I am not in high school and it is quite offensive to think I am, so now. I am an adult. Thank you.

The problem: My life experience has shown me that it is foolish to expect everyone to be your friend and to be nice to you just because you are nice. but the solution really annoys me and scares me because I know what happens when I put it to work, everyone avoids me and calls me a bitch, yet it somehow works for everyone else. Many girls I know, the most popular girls usually were really mean, so were the boys. So my nice \*\*\* ever tries to be mean or fight back when harassed and it becomes a really big problem, either the harasser laughs at me and continues to harass me or people just avoid me because they think I am confrontational and problematic, which I am not, I do not like conflicts but staying on my \*\*\* and never calling out people who used to bully me for years has proven to not be effective. They just continue to harass me no matter if I ignore them or call them out on their behavior

My goal is to understand this whole power play dynamic and why it takes place. Does my type of personality attract bullying? I remember having problems with it all of my life. Let me explain why I had this short prologue in the beginning. The stereotypical american online does not care much about the outside world. The laws of my country are very, very different from America, yet I have had people shame me for my problems or give me horrible advice in general or both. No, life is not an action movie and I am not the karate kid, No I am not a \*insert slur\* because I can't beat up a gang of guys on steroids, No where I live it is not okay to take a knife and stab my classmates( This advice was given to me by an american high school teacher, so good job!!!) I always have to explain to my self because most people on here give bad advice but some give brilliant and great advice that works for me. I am not saying all users are like those I gave example of and I have blocked and reported these people. I can write all day long about my encounters with weird people from reddit and quora but the point is for me to get  a good advice and not whine to all of you about each detail of my life. Some males on here can't imagine the female perspective and give really terrible advices and some males on here give really good universal advices that work for me.

I am deeply flawed so I have read books on self improvement and I would dare to say that I have made small self improvement which is better than none

I had a panic attack today and yesterday, was trembling and crying and felt like I was holding a really heavy box that I couldn't let go of. After crying for an hour and a half I seemed to calm down but felt better. I mentioned in my last post that I do not know any reasons why I am alive, I do not speak about my \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* thoughts antymore because one ""apperently christian"" classmate made fun of me after I kinda shared this to her on a school trip

(I have been heavily bullied in middle and high school and have a hard time making friends)

I now have ptsd, am full of shame, guilt, grief and struggle to find any reason to live. I feel ugly and broken beyond repair and am ashamed to go to another psychologist. I feel dirtied and r\*\*\*d and do not want to marry one of those people with the male genitalia or have children yet those who bullied me probably do not remember me and will have children while I will die alone. I just want this to end but now my parents watch me because I self hurt and stopped washing when I was 16 and felt the most suicidal during 10th grade. I still get ""waves"" of desire for suicide but I find it hard to find my purpose.

I try to eradicate my onw flaws - people pleasing, needyness, clingyness, desparation(Out of need for survival, I was desperate for friends yet did not know how to make them so here it is like unwritten rule that if you are alone you will be bullied and I am very vulnerable to bullying and can't deal with it which is why I was an easy target, i couldn't defend my self and no one took me seriously and if i ever defend my self people either laughed or threatened to beat me up. I also used to be overhappy which for some weird reason unnerved people. I am not autistic or on the spectrum but I have adhd, and sometimes my anxiety and adhd, create social problems but I have never been good. 

Half of the things I read about body language and communication skills baffle me and they seem genuienely stupid (like I avoid eye contact cause to me it seemed perverted yet the dumb males think it is submissive and take it as a que to harass me, great job. ) I am tired of this world and do not know what to mold my self into anymore to survive. I am ashamed of the fact that I have trauma and have to deal with it. I have had strangers bully me and laugh at me and even old men flirting with me which made me isolate my self even more. 

Important:

I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO BE A B TO EVERYONE IN ORDER TO PROTECT MY SELF AND SURVIVE AND SHOW THE DUMB MALE GENDER THAT I AM NOT WEAK AND I AM NOT UGLY AND I DO NOT WANT OR DESERVE TO BE HARASSED AND BULLIED. If I am nice they harass me, if I am mean, they harass me. Like what is the point, they will go to the heartless pretty b anyway, so I stand no chance and do not want my life purpose to revolve around the others and expecting of them to be nice to me. I do not feel like I am safe around men, I feel like they would beat me up, and I see women as a competetion due to the hostile bullying in my past. I know guys are dumb enough to fall for literally the meanest girls when I was in school so I will no longer waste my time on them and just try to not \*\*\* my self and focus on me. I try to develop my hobbies but my mind is plauging me and I feel the need to \*\*\* my self, by either taking overdose with pills or my father's pistol and just shooting towards my heart so I would not miss. Phrases like - OOOh not all men are bad, scare me because it is a risk and 8/10 times guys are horrible so it is not wroth it. I do not want to date, marry, or have children. I want to give up on men and realize this mindset is toxic but do not feel physically safe around those with the d\*cks",suicide
2838,"Fuck this shit. I'm finally done.I'm ending it. I've been going through bullshit day in and day out every single motherfucking day of my life.

I cry every morning when I wake up, I cry during the day if I can find a place to be alone, and I cry myself to sleep every night. 

I don't have any friends. I haven't had any friends for over a year. I am sociable, but people don't want to hang out with me.

My mom is verbally and psychologically abusive. My job hates me and threatens to fire me all the time. Then I would have bills to pay that I couldn't pay. I have nowhere to go and no one to go to.

I was trying to make brownies earlier, and I spilled a little bit of chocolate on the counter. Maybe the size of a quarter. My mom went ape-shit telling me how I need to take a cooking class and calling me a ""fucking retard"" and saying, ""What did I do to deserve you as a child?"" that there's ""chocolate everywhere; all over the counter, paper towels, in the sink"" and none of this bullshit is fucking true. I am a neat freak. I'm not a slob.

I always try to not let it bother me, but fuck, it fucking bothers me enough that I've decided to end my life. If she hears me crying she says ""fuck you"" and if I continue to cry she takes my car keys away (by force, I will fight her) and take my cell phone away and probably try to choke me which she has done before.

I'm 19 years old and I already feel too old for this. I am so tired that I feel like I'm 90. I'm tearing up and so afraid to cry that it's making it harder to hold it in.

I always kinda felt bad about thinking about killing myself by thinking my family would miss me. Maybe they will, and maybe my mom will be miserable forever but now that is what I *want*. My mom always tells my family members that I am a horrible person. That I lie and steal, and that I do horrible things that I have never done in my life. She lies to their faces in front of me, and I have to get lectured every time I see them about something stupid my mom told them I did.

A few days ago, I had a dream where me and the more athletic version of my sister’s boyfriend from two years ago were in the street in front of my house. It was dark outside and the only light was a dim street light that’s on the corner of my house. We were confronted by a mixed race Michael Cera, wearing a basketball jersey, holding up a sign saying,”I’m not racist”. He then rips part of the sign that says “not”, and as you guessed it reads out,”I’m racist”. He then runs towards us and we start fighting back. Except in my dream, I jumped onto his back to sorta disable him and my sister’s boyfriend is the one beating him up. We then beat him up to the point where he’s a tiny person, and we poke his eyes out. Then all of a sudden, we’re inside holding a tiny, frail baby that looks like it was boiled in water.

For weeks I've worked overtime shifts from 4:30am and again from 8pm-midnight just so we can pay bills. I literally sleep 2 non-consecutive hours each night. I'm a teacher, he hasn't been to work since the 3rd because of ""medical leave"" AKA he was hungover two days running and then has been drinking every day since. I have to fast for the next 3 weeks which is actually ok, I've done it for weeks before, but also necessary because we don't have any food. He's skinny and can't skip meals, I'm a fucking fatass which is probably partly why the only man who wanted me is a useless, horrible drunk. 

My friends have homes, have families. He's alienated me from everyone - I no longer speak to anyone in my family after one nightmarish drunken episode after another. I have no friends. I have become a drunk, too - at first it was to cope and then it was to keep him from having every drop. I spend most evenings hiding booze from him, hiding cards, hiding keys. He drinks until his head bobs around, until he stumbles and breaks things and 100% denies he's drunk. 

I never should have gone to university. I never should have left that shithole town. I should have married the best farmer and shut my fucking mouth. I hate my life. I hate every day I wake up.

2869,"Low mood from issues at work(Also posted on r/advice)

23, M, UK

Evening all. I’m relatively new to reddit but have been lurking a while and noticed that this sub gives decent advice, and I’m feeling quite low this evening and feel I need to share my thoughts if you don’t mind.

I’ve been at my place of work three years, I love it. It’s the industry I’ve always wanted to work in, the pay and benefits are great and I love the day to day stuff. I’ve attached myself to a group of friends which is great too, but over the past year there’s been a few times where people inside this friendship group have made some comments “in jest” which have really hurt me. I’ve tried writing it off as banter plenty of times, and I know I am oversensitive so have to write some of it off as that too, but especially recently I’ve been struggling to cope more and more. 

Like this afternoon for example; I was in a perfectly happy mood having worked on my own all day, then walk into the office to complete some paperwork before I go home and three of the guys are in there. The dominant influencer of the three makes some comments dressed as “banter”, and instantly I feel a sense of dread. Like someone has pressed a light switch, I feel a warm queasy feeling all over my body and I feel my chest go all fluttery. I struggle not to cry in front of them and leave quickly. I won’t go into the comments made, not because they are particularly nasty or anything but it requires inside knowledge of the job I do and that would take even longer to explain. 

Anyway so I’m feeling pretty terrible about all this, and begin to have violent visualisations where I’m hurting myself, like deeply cutting into my arms or falling from a tall building and my bones smashing. I can’t stop these visions from appearing in my head and I’m almost craving the physical sensation that they depict. I do have a history of depression and low mood which stems from childhood (I’m 23 now).  In recent times these visions of me hurting myself seem to become my default response to feeling low. The violent thoughts soon progress into suicidal thoughts and I then spiral and get more &amp; more upset.

I can’t tell work how I feel because if I admit the thoughts in my head I will be taken away from the work that I love and probably end up being made to go sick which will make me feel 100x worse.

My bf knows I get sad from time to time but I don’t want to burden him with my problems because I’m scared that it’ll put him off (which is pretty illogical because we live together and have been together a good while). I don’t like burdening my parents either because they’ve got their own worries. 

I don’t want to confront the boy because when I’ve told him before that he’s upset me I’m made to feel like the one in the wrong because I can’t handle the banter. Likewise I can’t report it to work because I don’t want to be labelled a grass, and I’ve always believed I should have the courage to confront the person and if I can’t or won’t do that then I shouldn’t get anyone else involved.

I know I’m giving excuses for literally every possible solution, (and I’m sorry about that because I can’t stand it when others do that) but I guess just writing this post is helping to a degree 

Thanks for listening to me, anon internet user. Wish I had the balls to tell someone in real life.

2888,"I just really want someone to talk too (15m)I have always had anxiety and depression. Recently I have been getting more and more suicidal. My gf left me and if i'm honest I don't/didn't think anyone does/will love me. We dated for around a year and a half, and then out of the blue she sent me a text saying it was over. I tried to talk to her but she told me I was gonna end up dead because I haven't asked for help. Shes so mad at me now and for the person you love so much to say the things she said. I feel so crushed. I have been looking into suicide methods for about a year now. I always thought it was comforting that I could just stop the pain ,but now I think more and more about it and i'm thinking its almost time. I guess i'm just looking for a reason to get off the edge. I'm so scared of death but I can't stand another day of trying and trying for nothing. I just don't want to be a problem anymore. To be clear I have talked to my mom who is the only person I can imagine caring about me a little. I told her for 20 minutes how much I hate myself and just want it to stop. She talked about getting me help and then forgot about it. I don't think I can do that again. It was so draining to tell her all of that for nothing. I know i'm just another kid and maybe this is all going to resolve with time but I cannot stress how much I just want a way out. I have been searching for my moms gun and when I find it that will be the night.

I graduated in May summa cum laude from a top 30 school. I grew up (and live in) a very wealthy town, and there was always something very ""special"" about me, yadda yadda yadda. 

So I go into college, destroy shit. Everyone talks about how great I am. I'm an amazing writer. I produce the type of work people expect out of students at Ivy League advanced degree programs. I have a lot of friends who care about me, which wasn't really true in high school. I loved college. I wrote an amazing Senior Thesis even though I shattered my collarbone in the middle of writing it and had to type with one hand. Everyone told me I should drop out and graduate a semester late, but I powered through it and got all As that last semester. 

Now I can't get a job. The job ""search"" been the most dehumanizing, degrading process in which I've been involved (including being ""initiated"" by a sports team and having to lick a used dildo) and I've felt sick the past few months. Not sick at myself, because I know I'm doing everything right. Sick at the country and sick at other people. 

I made it to the final round at a prestigious med-tech company for a position paying $65k out of college. They told me during the interview that I seemed like a great fit. I killed it at the interview and thought I was guaranteed a job. Two weeks later: rejected, and they wouldn't tell me why. Because of privacy. Whatever that means.

While that was devastating, I don't give up easily. I got to another final round interview for a consulting job at a Top 50 consulting firm and was asked a ridiculous case study question. The answer to the case was demeaning and unfair, and everyone I've spoken to agrees with me. Unsurprised and unruffled when they rejected me. 

This was all during the summer, and now it's fall. I can't find anything. I send out 50 applications a week, and nobody even responds to me. I do everything right. I try to network, and everyone tries to help. I've spoken with 100 alumni so far, and each phone call is the same. They gush over my resume, and then tell me that their company isn't hiring. Sometimes, when there is a position, they personally hand my resume and cover letter to HR, which is pretty much the best thing possible when applying for jobs. Doesn't matter, I don't hear anything back.

I don't want to see my friends anymore because I'm too embarrassed about not having a job. I can't sleep because I just dream about being offered jobs and actually being happy. My career counselor started crying while she was speaking with me because she felt so bad for me and couldn't understand why I wasn't getting interviews. 

I've felt myself become racist. If I weren't a white male, I would have a job now. I blame affirmative action. I'm becoming a cynical asshole. I used to be interested in learning, but now I don't care anymore. I regret picking my college (even though I loved it), my major (loved it), and my internships (loved them). 

For some reason, I can't get myself to apply to a post-grad internship. Money isn't the problem. I'm a very moral person (not my moral compass being amazing, just that I consider the ethics of every action I make), and I can't let myself apply. The thought of working for free contributing to an economy which hates me is a thought that makes me sick. 

I no longer want to contribute to the US economy because I don't believe in the country anymore. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't see what other choice I have. I'm the hero this country deserves, not the one it needs. :)

I don't want to go quietly. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I want to destroy something important. Some action to make everyone realize that this country is not OK, is not safe, and does not offer the opportunity it promises. I've given myself until November 1 to find a job. 

Tell me I'm a fucking dipshit. Don't tell me I'm smart and admirable and worthy, because that's what everyone has told me my entire life.

2901,"Need some help in MS/LA...I'm male, and I live around the Mississippi/Lousiana border near Slidell, and I don't know what to do really...


To start off, I've had minor depression issues on and off for 14 years, but this year it culminated in me actually needing to get meds to help control it, same with anxiety. I've been on the meds for 11 months and I'm in worse shape than in January. Recently, it's become amplified infinitely, due to my wife out of the blue wanting to split up due to a few 'mishaps' in our relationship over the years. I was completely blindsided by this, and she refuses to talk it over, do couples therapy. I'm addicted to her, and we've been together since mid-2005, before I turned 15, and we have 4 kids together, 2 who live with us (2 were adopted out early on in our relationship)


Due to all this, I've been at wits end, considering downing every bottle of pills I can find, and even had the cops and e-squad called on me earlier this week, and I lied to them about me bordering on taking all the pills or not. I don't even want to be in this shape due to my kids. It pains me enough just to sit alone, bawling my eyes out and having to tell my kids to give me a few minutes. 


I saw a counselor on Monday, and she said that I need to work on myself, and throughout my life, I've been told I'm too self-centered, so I have a hard time even doing things for myself anymore, and for psychiatric help, I was told the two closest places earliest I could get in would be three and five months. I've been teetering on self-committment, but I'm worried that something like that could be leveraged against me to keep me from seeing my kids in the future...

The thing is, I convinced my partner to go to the psychiatrist. He got prescribed meds. Everything seemed to be going well, until...
There is this boy that is my best friends for 10 years. There was never chemistry between us, we are just mates. Throughout our friendship he did some nasty things to me, but somehow we always got back.
When I started dating my partner he immediately hated my friend. I told him some bad things that the did to me in the past and it formed an image of an abuser in the head of my partner. The truth is, I should have held my emotions, but even though I tried to explain to him that it's not the case anymore, he hates the friend guy very much. He never openly told threatened me, but after every conversation we have about the friend he gets extremely suicidal. Two days ago he locked himself in the bathroom and later he told me that he held a sharp object and wanted to kill himself, he was very close. I cried like crazy and he told me that he is disappointed that the most important person for him reacts in such way, because it makes him feel like a bad person.
I have no idea what to do. I don't want to lose a long time friend and I feel emotionally manipulated. I have not told anyone because I'm scared that my partner will get mad and will do something bad to himself. When I told him I feel manipulated he wanted to kill himself for being a bad person for me because he felt like psychopath and he hated himself for that. On the other hand, I distanced myself from the friend and he is angry at me for that. He doesn't understand why I did that and he feels cheated because our friendship was very important for both of us. So. Here I am alone. With everyone being angry at me, I feel constant guilt and need to do everything my partner wants me to. I love him very much and I don't want him to end himself. But I also don't want to be put in the position where I need to chose between friend or partner. I feel really sick of this all, I have no idea what to do. My partner doesn't want to go to the therapy with me. He also doesn't want to get any more psychological help. I cannot force him, it must be his decisions. I feel so alone.

Anyone has any tips on how to talk with either of them? I feel embarrased that I got myself to be so manipulated and I don't want to admit it to my friend because he will tell me to leave my partner. And I CANT live him. I would feel guilty if anything bad happens to him. I feel the responsibility for too many people at once. I want to see counselor but first I decided to do a research on the Internet and ask you on this subreddit. How to talk with suicidal people?

The thing is, I don't know what I am going to do, but I know what I want to do; I want to take one of my kitchen knives, slash my throat and then start stabbing myself until I exit this world. I want the pain, I want the agony.

Anyway, just a few more days. I feel empty. I've given myself the liberty to do whatever I want for the next couple of days but there's nothing I want to do, you know? I've given up trying to finish my reading list; I read a sentence--sometimes a page--and then close the book. I even bought the VC Pokemon Silver thinking 'well, might as well' but I regret buying it now :(

I don't know why I'm typing this. I'm just bored, I guess. Well, more restless than bored. I'm probably not thinking things through again--maybe the rope I'll buy won't be able to hold my weight, maybe someone will find me before I die, maybe I won't even get that window of opportunity, etc.

In terms of planning I don't have much to think about. I had one constraint at first--I didn't want my grandma to know I had killed myself--but recent events has made me realize I don't care about that anymore; my parents will probably hide it from her anyway.

I feel weird, like I'm just faking this. I've thought about suicide countless of times before but I was always sad or angry. Now I'm just... content? Like I'm not sad enough or angry enough to even think of suicide but here I am anyway.

No, I don't want to do anything about it. I know you're thinking I wouldn't be posting this if I didn't want help but I just want to leave this here like a note of some sort.

That’s when I started thinking about ending my life. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense to me. I hate being stuck in the same old loop. I fight tooth and nail for change, and I always end up with the same result - nothing.

2972,"And I'm the selfish one. The asshole he calls me.Mom made me marry him at 17 in Chester, VA.  I gave him my virginity.  He gave me herpes.  We had a quick 15 minute ceremony at a lawyers office.  My honeymoon took place at the Sheraton on Midlothian tnpk.  Special....until he said he took all his gf's there.  A year later we moved in with my Grandma to save money and get a house.  At this point we were the proud owners of a ford festiva, $155 a month.  He worked at the local ford dealership.  Needless to say we couldnt move an apartment full of furniture in that micromachine car.  So he bought an f150.  $330/month.  Why did we move to my G'mas?  I went to see my cousins baby with my G'ma. He got mad and went out drinking.  Drove home down the train tracks.   I had two daughters while living in that basement.  He had 2 motorcycles and a boat and a bronco. After 5 years I got the hell out.  To the second apartment.  I got a job cleaning houses.  I bought me an $1100 1980 something mustang.  We moved into a trailer.  I bought me a new 1999 mustang.  We moved 2 more times.  I got a job driving a school bus.  I went to college inbetween.  We moved in with his mother so I could attend nursing school full time.  Big mistake.  Quit and went to respiratory school.  Moved to the east coast of Va.  He bought a bigger boat since we were on the chesapeake bay/rappahannock river.  I tried several times to buy a house, turn down after turn down.  At one point before nursing school I wanted to volunteer at the resque squad.  He wouldnt allow it.  I would be around men...at night.  So I worked in a hospital full of men.  Things that can be done in a confused patients room.  Woooo Guess who got fired and found a job working at nigh?  You guessed it.  Not me.  Effing hypocrit
My daughter turned into a holy terror.  Didnt listen.  Came and went as she wanted.  Had 2 kids I had to take care of at night.  Had to put up with her shit and the trash she brought home.  They didnt listen either.  I begged my husband to quit his job.  I needed him there with me before I killed myself to get away from the shit.  I hated to come home after work so I would stay with my other daughter at her house. We filed bankruptcy after his heart attack because he ""couldnt"" work.   Finally left the state to get away.  This summer 2019, we were close to buying a house.  Until he saw an expedition he wanted.  What was wrong with my equinox at 191 a month?  538 for the expedition.  I let it known that we would not be able to a house again.  Do you think he cared?  He wined like a damn kid until I couldnt take it and said go fucking get it.  Im living with my mother in law.  I have ALS and I'm dying.  Not quick enough.  I married the most selfish SOB Ive ever met.  I have came to the place I literally hate him.  I want to die to get away from him.
Im not perfect.  The night before we got married I was with my exboyfriend.  Who, after 27 years I found him.  I learned a lot that I didnt know was going on in his life.  I wish he would have talked to me about it.  I showed my tits to a few people.  Some got to play and kiss them.  Few years ago hubs dick stopped working due to meds.  Seems to me IF you actually loved your wife you could make lifestyle changes to get off heart meds or use other means to get your wife off.  So I think he doesnt care.  I got' caught sexting with other redditors.  That didnt go well. I was diagnosed with ALS in the morning and he bitched me out calling me everything he could that afternoon.  I guess having been given a death sentence I forgot to delete his texts.
I want a clock that tunes on the hour and to go to the mutter museum and die in my own house.  Do you think that he would do  either for me?  Nope.

One person doesn't stand a chance, nearly everything stacks up against them to make even a local change. I don't know what I could possibly say to find that kind of person anymore. I am exhausted.

i’m 18

molested by mom until 13

she’s an alcoholic, pathological liar, and straight up certified piece of shit

dad suffered from drug addiction and schizophrenia and wasn’t around much

he killed him self about 8 months ago

i basically spent my entire childhood alone

my brother and sister were popular and i didn’t have friends, when their friends were over they were always mean so i’d just hide in my room

my brother grew up with living with his well-off dad (same mom,different dad) and he doesn’t understand what our mom put me and my sister through (stealing money from us, fucking our credit, calling cops on us, just being a typical alcoholic shitbag)

even my sister barely understands what i went through, for some reason my mom just decided to pick me to molest and physically abuse

i’ve only told 2 people about what i’ve been through and their the only people in my life

my sister and kayla

i met kayla in a mental hospital last november 

we were both there from friday until tuesday

we became really close in there and talked about everything to each other

we’d walk the hallways back and forth all day just talking about whatever we were thinking of at the moment

i wrote my number on a piece of paper and gave it to her, i was really nervous but she seemed excited to keep contact when we got out

the first day she got out she broke up with her emotionally abuse ex

he’d keep messaging her on different social media’s after she blocked his number/facebook/instagram

over the next 2 weeks we hung out probably 6-7 times even though we’re both busy with work all the time

she seemed to show some interest in me

she said i smelled good and she said i have pretty eyes all the time

we’d always have these moments where’d we just stare into each other’s eyes not saying anything but it wasn’t awkward at all

her ex showed up at her house one night and it’s all gone down south from there

we went from hanging out all the time and texting about our days to barely seeing or talking to each other

in the past month we’ve only hung out twice, she’s even cancelled a couple times

at first i wasn’t sure if it was him controlling her or if i was just looking too into things

today we talked on the phone for a bit, she said she’s been busy with work, school, and seeing someone

she asked me if i wanted to hang out tonight (to smoke)

everytime we’ve hung out, i’ve smoked her up, and the two times we hung out in december it was when she was out of weed

since i was busy with work i asked what she was doing tomorrow, she’s cooking dinner at her place with a friend

so now i think she’s seeing someone that not her ex and now that she’s sees how i’m such a depressed shy piece of shit that doesn’t talk about anything but his childhood problems she doesn’t really enjoy my company anymore and just wants weed out

the only time i’ve ever felt any sort of happiness is with her and now it feels like it’s all gone and i’m worse off than before

It all started last year when I was let go from a well paying job, I was unemployed for months draining all my savings while unemployment paid me little to nothing. I applied to so many jobs that I was hopeful for only to get rejection after rejection. I had finally got a job months later but the pay was just enough to get me by month to month. I was struggling but was making it work. Then that job contract recently ended prematurely and I am back on unemployment with little to no savings and not getting enough to pay my bills per month. I am constantly asking my dad to bail me out of going into more debt and getting evicted every month and this month the debt has just piled up and don’t have enough to pay my rent or even buy food. I have been again getting rejection after rejection on jobs and it’s made me realize I’m not as good as I thought I was. The past 10 years of my life working and building up my resume has just been a waste of time it seems. I have an interview today with a job, but if I get rejected on this one then I am just going to end it. I can’t keep asking my dad for money, I’m about to be 30 and can’t even be a proper adult living independently. This is my final option, either I am offered that job or I end it all to save the financial drain I am causing everyone. Sure they will be sad I did it and angry I didn’t ask for more help, but constantly asking for financial help is the bigger drain.

is it better for them (2 kids and wife) if they know it was suicide or is it better just to smash my car into a wall at 120km/ph...

im leaning towards the car...as it will make payout by the insurers more likely and they may guess but not know for sure which i think would be more beneficial for the kids to get over. the wife could even say it was an accident and they don't need to know.

the only reason an overdose seem better would be the comfort but then 120 into a wall wouldn't last long...

With my doctor's help I've tried various cocktails of Zoloft, Lexapro, Abilify, Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Adderall and Ativan. None have helped my depression in a significant way. I've leaned on friends and family for support, improved my diet, and learned mindfulness meditation. (But I must admit I was never able to stick to the meditation for more than a week at a time.)

In short, I spent the last 14 months trying to get rid of my depression, but here I am tonight on SuicideWatch feeling as bad as I've ever felt.

I attempted to take my life last year, but my kidneys and liver were stronger than I gave them credit for. If I try again it will be with the help of the Golden Gate Bridge, which I'm told is 99% effective.

I know that if I continue to fight there's still a chance my depression would go away and I could end up happy again. The odds of this happening lie somewhere between 0 and 100%. But I also know that if I end my life the chances of the pain ending are 100%, and I won't be around to regret it. I suppose that's the tautology of suicide. Nobody who has killed themself has ever regretted it.

I'm practically convinced that ending my life is the better of my two options. The downside of course is the emotional toll it would take on my friends and family. But I counter that with the emotional and financial toll I'm already taking and would continue to take on them in the future.

Although I'm pretty convinced of my decision, I obviously haven't committed to it since I'm here asking for help. Your advice will be appreciated.",suicide

The hardest part was knowing I could never be you, now all I do is sit around and wish I could forget you. Who are you to me? Who am I to you? Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence? By default, you are my only link to the outside psychosomatic suicide. Where were you when I was down, can you show me a way to face everyday with this face? When I blur my eyes, they make the whole world breathe, I see you fucking me and I am absolutely controlling every urge to mutilate.

3044,"I do nothing but hurt people.  Sorry in advance for the novel...

I have no family and no friends whom I do not hurt.  I'm a selfish bitch and I honestly feel that I would be doing a service to the world if I expunge myself from it.  To allow myself, as destructive as I am, to continue to live would be selfish.

Today was my breaking point.  The two people I respect and look up to the most in the entire world I have hurt and disappointed, and they are upset with me and I cannot take it anymore.  They are my research advisors, (they are married), and I loved them as dearly as a daughter would love her parents (I always wanted parents, but I've been alone my whole life, save for a meth-addicted father who sold my body to his friends for drug money when I was 13-14 and is now in prison).  

Recently, I was taken advantage of by an old high school friend and I've been struggling emotionally since that night. Two days ago, I told one of them that I was really anxious and a bit vulnerable, but yesterday he completely snapped at me (for what I perceive as no real reason - it was a miscommunication).  I left the lab in tears, but I returned today because I do have work to do.  However, when I arrived my other advisor took me aside and told me that I'm too emotional and that I have been causing stress to her husband, whom I idolize.

And two days ago, I made on of my friends cry.  What the hell is wrong with me?  I can't take it anymore.  I can't take the fact that I'm so self-absorbed I hurt everyone, EVERY ONE I care about.  I can't stand myself.

I am truly convinced at this point that getting over my fear of death would be the right thing to do.  ",suicide

3048,"I can't force myself to care anymoreSorry if this doesn't make sense, my memories from the last few months are a little broken. Can't really piece it together too well.  


A little over 7 months ago, I broke up with my long term highschool girlfriend in search of a more fulfilling life. When we got together, she didn't want me smoking weed anymore, so I stopped. I was a pothead of a sort, so this made me a little sad, but I decided it was worth it. So naturally, when we broke up, I started smoking again. What else should a highschool senior be doing? I smoked every single day for about 7 months, trying all sorts of new drugs along the way. Cigarettes. Alcohol. Opiates. Shrooms. LSD. MDMA. Cocaine. All sorts of fun stuff. I thought that they would give me a new perspective on life, but they only left me as a shell of the person I used to be. I graduated high school about 3 months after I broke up with her, and that's when my drug use really took off. I chose to attend college about 300 miles away from my hometown in an effort to start anew, to be a different person. But now, all I am is alone. I live in a huge city with no money, I'm on the verge of failing some important classes, and have nothing left. All I want is to not be me anymore. I don't want to be anyone. I just want to be nothing. The more and more that I wonder what else I could have been, the more and more it all hurts. All the cries for help, all the lonely nights, all the account overdrawal emails and antidepressants that never worked, they all contributed to who I am as a person today. I've tried to blame people for creating the monster that I am, but the only person there is to blame is me. I'm my own Dr. Frankenstein. After I tried to kill myself, I thought it best to seek out a therapist, and maybe some antidepressant medication. Therapy doesn't do jack shit, and the only thing I have to thank my medication for is my now nonexistent sex drive. Life is so fucking bland, and christ, it's fucking killing me. ",suicide

Indifferent, I'm just so apathetic to basically everything, and if there's something that makes me laugh or feel happy then it gets worse because i have to feel nothing again and that's bad.

I don't want to kill myself, but the idea of dying isn't so bad, like by something you can't control, I probably don't have the guts to do it myself and I lost my train of thought lol, brainstorming this is a shitty idea but why not.

So basically something like dying while sleeping, at least a ""peaceful"" death might not seem to bad, I know there are people who love me and all that but I don't feel much, I try liking people too, but after all the times I was rejected, I can't bring myself to love anyone or simply I haven't met her yet, even if I don't know if that's gonna happen.

Questions...I'd prefer if an actual psychologist/-iatrist/hospital employee/doctor/etc. answer this, but any help or support is appreciated. See my post history for more info. What would happen if I checked myself into the hospital for being homicidal? I.e. I'm not really an insane person, just severely depressed/enraged and in a completely intolerable situation that makes me feel this way towards the person I live with. I don't really have anywhere else to go (not much money.) I've asked my shrink before (not seeing her again until a few days from now,) but I forgot what she said, and I feel like she may have sugarcoated it anyway to make me more likely to go. Obviously, I don't want to be locked up forever, but the truth is that, unless the circumstances change, I'm probably not going to stop feeling this way, so as soon as/if they release me, I'll be just as dangerous as I am now. Also, I have insurance but ER bills are still insane (been before for different reasons.) As of this moment, I'm not totally off the wall, but I feel that way for a good amount of the day, every day and I don't see how it's going to get any better. Would a knowledgeable person educate me as to what would happen? ALSO, someone I know with a ton of mutual friends works in the ER of one of the hospitals in town.

We both don’t know what we look like because we haven’t exchanged pictures yet but we started dating because of each other’s personalities.

Everyday i feel like i’m becoming more of a shallow shell focusing on my looks and nothing else. It’s consuming me and my time and i waste so much time in the day having panic attacks when i look in the mirror and then get motivated to change myself and then freak out again because i look terrible.

3104,"I don't even know why I'm posting here.I found this sub yesterday. And I started reading. And I started crying. And haven't stopped. I turned 21 about 6 weeks ago. I never thought I'd live to see this day. I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 18. I never tried it again. I sought help. Got therapy. Was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Became a well-rounded and balanced individual. I can control my schizophrenia so well I only need the drugs on a bad day. 

Spring break was last week. I spent 90% of it curled up in the fetal position on my bed. I didn't move. I didn't sleep. I didn't eat. I didn't speak. I've realized that no matter how happy I seem on the outside, I'm just a hollow, empty shell. There's nothing to me anymore. I don't care about life. I don't care about anything. I remembered what it was like to want to die. 

So I started listing reasons. 

I hate myself. I always have. I find myself annoying, obnoxious and insufferable. How I have friends (and willing friends) I will never understand. I'm too loud. Too boyish. Too dumb. I drive people away because I complain. About everything. I'm awkward. I suck at living. I'm incredibly irresponsible. I can't even keep my school work straight. I can't keep my life organised. I'm so afraid to move out of my parents house and be on my own. I don't even know that I can function as a member of society. I can barely keep my minimum wage job. I can't even keep myself on track to lose weight for my health. It makes me find myself so completely awful and unattractive that I can't even look at myself. I hate that I don't even have any guts. See, there's this guy I've been friends with for a while now. Before this downward spiral I've hit, he made me feel things I'd never felt for anyway. I fell in love with him in a very real way. But I don't have the guts to even tell him that I'm romantically attracted to him, let alone how deep my feelings have gotten. Even if I did, there would be no point. Who could love someone so pathetic? Who could find someone that looks like me even remotely attractive? Either way, I'm fairly certain I've driven him away, too. And then there's all the financial problems with student loans. And my parents relationship. No matter what I do, I'm always the cause of their fights. I'm fairly certain that everyone's lives would improve without me.

I just don't know anymore. What's the point on pushing through this? I've had these feelings for years and nothing has EVER gotten better, even with my therapist, anti-depressants, even attempting this before. Maybe I should have died a long time ago. Maybe I shouldn't have even been born. 

That's not to say I won't be missed. Of course I would. I know I would devastate so many people if I took myself away from them. That's the only thing that's stopping me, and I'm so close to it not even mattering anymore. I would be at peace. Isn't that what would matter? It's incredibly selfish, I know.

Drunk Brits are being sensible and having fun in pubs after more than 20 pints while the preachy teetotal subhumans are spitting in other people's faces, yelling at managers because their food wasn't healthy enough, and going on about how it's healthy to not smoke.

I am a disgusting piece or shit for not drinking, smoking or eating food that tastes GOOD.  I am a preachy fucking degenerate.  People like me cough in people's faces while telling ACTUAL HUMANS off for throwing up and getting others to hold their hair back like most sensible British people.  I don't deserve to be British. 

Being a clean eater most of the time makes me a gross asshole.  It is impossible to change my personality and to get rid of these VILE habits that make me an obnoxious dangerous asshole to other people.

If I can't change my personality to enjoy throwing up while drunk in public, smoking and eating junk food most of the time, by tomorrow, I am going to end my life.

3126,"Flash Archive Porn Review You may have saw my post a little earlier, but here's some background if you haven't. Earlier today I downloaded Flashpoint because Adobe Flash is shutting down later this year and I wanted a chance to revisit all the flash games I played as a kid. Turns out that while it does have what I wanted there's a little more on top; **flash porn**. Most of these are ""games"", games in quotations because really, they're just animations that I can control the speed of. One thing I noticed right away is that the majority of it was furry porn. If you're not into that then Flashpoint might not be the best place to look for fap material. I would have to guess about 65% of the porn is actually yiff. Like I said, not everyone is into that and you might want to avoid that, and that brings me to the next point and that is the lack of previews. The only thing you see is the title and site the animation was hosted on, no tags or thumbnails included. This means that picking something to jerk off to is purely a guess, but it's also more rewarding to find something good because of said guesswork. However, most of what isn't furry shit is low quality, which is understandable considering that most flash content was produced in the 2000's. With all that said, I did end up finding something to nut to, and yes it was yiff, not afraid to admit that.

Overall, I would give using Flashpoint a 6/10 as a source of fap material. It's not practical for your everyday fap, but if you're looking to spice things up and suprise yourself a little it's worth checking out",non-suicide

I checked the lotion I had used, it's face wash lotion for your skin it has hyaluronic, which is meant to dry out the skin. Of course the moron I am used it to to jerk off, and now I'm paying for my consequences.

3130,"Please Help Me, I am Desperate :(I posted this on reddit recently:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/jd05j6/i\_dont\_know\_what\_to\_do\_i\_need\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/ittgnt/i_dont_know_what_to_do_i_need_help/)

Recently, I have been obsessing/ruminating on the stuff that I described in that post. It is on my mind 24/7. I feel suicidal all the time because of it, and everyday I think about suicide all the time. I struggle to get out of bed on a lot of days because of how overwhelming the suicidal thoughts are (sometimes when I wake up I stay in bed for 3-4 hours before getting out of bed). Everyday when I try to do my uni work, I am unable to work for long periods of time because of the anxiety/suicidal thoughts which I experience, and because of this I end up having to catch up on my work later at night, so I end up going to bed at \~ 5 am every morning. My sleep schedule is awful because of this.

I find it really hard to interact with others (whether in person or online) because I always get really paranoid that I might unintentionally do something that might upset them.

I am seeing a therapist about it, and I am trying to do the 'homework tasks' he gives me every week, but I am not seeing any improvement. I am also taking medication, I have not noticed any improvement from that either.

I also tried ERP with an OCD group program a few months ago, and throughout the group program the ERP was working and I was somewhat hopeful, but the day after the program finished all of the progress I had made instantly reversed and all of the worries I had came back and I was unable to do the exposures anymore (I don't know why this happened).

I don't really see the point of anything anymore. I'm just a leech who is a burden on others and makes their lives worse. I don't contribute anything positive to society.

I often find it hard to do the homework tasks that my therapist gives me because I am constantly in a low mood and I have zero motivation. And even though I try my best to do the homework tasks, I don't really see the point of doing them, I feel like no matter how hard I try I will never get better. My worries and low mood get in the way of everything I do, and that includes all the effort I put in to try and improve my situation.

A few weeks ago, I was obsessing over the stuff I described in the post I linked, and it got particularly overwhelming on that day and I did not know what to do, and I tried to kill myself. It didn’t work (obviously) and now I am really upset because I feel like I might have to stay one this Earth and be miserable and anxious for many decades to come. Suicide felt like my last option and since that failed, I don’t know what to do.

When I am feeling super anxious/depressed/suicidal, nothing can calm me down (including the things I wrote down on the safety plan I made with my therapist). I am tempted to call/message a friend when I feel this way, but after the thing I described in the linked post, I always feel like I am a burden on others when I talk to them about this stuff.

I feel so lonely all the time, but when I talk to either, either in person or online, I constantly get anxious, and when I see how I discussed in the earlier post I linked (again, either in person or online), I have a really bad anxiety attack and I feel suicidal and I can’t deal with it properly. So I feel super lonely but I am too scared to talk to other people. I am pretty sure that nobody gives a fuck about me, and I don’t blame them because I truly am a fucking loser.

I just don’t want to be here anymore. The constant low moods, loneliness and anxiety I experience everyday is unbearable. I can’t take it anymore.",suicide

3134,"How I skipped online school and got away with it. So where I'm from, some students( including me) still have to do online school because there is still a pretty big number of COVID-19 cases in my area. The thing is, at my highschool we are still forced to do EVERY class we did when we were going to school, including P.E( even tho some of us barely have the room to do it).

 I'm really bad at P.E, and today we had to do push ups, and I can't do push ups to save my life, so I decided that I wouldn't go to P.E class today. Now, if I simply didn't join the online meeting I would get in trouble, so I needed to come up with an excuse. I couldn't just come out with a simple one like ""I was sick"" or ""I needed to go to the dentist"" because this was not the first time I didn't join a P.E meeting and the professor would figure out I'm BS-ing. So I needed to come up with a plan. 

I wear braces, and I go to the dentist at least once a month for a monthly check, and everytime I go, they give me a little ticket with the date of the next appointment. For exemple, in January they gave me a ticket saying ""23 february 14:15""(I live in Europe). And guess what I thought of. If only I could write over that 23 a 17 without  my P.E teacher realising that I wrote over it, go to the dentist, give a photo of me at the dentist and a photo with the little falsified locket to the teacher so that I have ""proof"" that I really went to the dentist, I could get away with it. 

So that's exactly what I did. I wrote 17 over 23, it wasnt perfect but it didn't needed to be, I changed, washed my teeth( so that I would really feel in character) and went to the dentist. Now I didn't go in the dentist's cabinet, that would have been too much, but I went outside of it and photographed it. I also photographed the ticket, but I left a little bit of it outside the photo, mostly the part where it said ""17"" because I figured if the teacher saw that I went to the dentist, and saw the ticket, he wouldn't ask why a little part of the ticket was missing. I already went too far, if he wasnt already satisfied with this, then I don't know what I could have gone. 

And then I went back home. Ironically, on my way back home, I ran into another classmate who also missed P.E because she went to the dentist, but she was telling the truth. I showed her my little trick and she couldn't believe that I went that far just to miss P.E. The teacher didn't respond to my message and the 2 photos, but he also didn't respond to the message of my other classmate saying she went to the dentist, so that means that he believes me, or at least that now both of us are in the same boat.

In conclusion, I don't really recommend doing what I did, but I'm very socially anxious and I don't like people watching me doing things that I'm horrible at( like pushups) at all. I feel like everyone is looking at me even though I'm sure most of them are also having a lot of trouble with it, too. But Chaotic Good does what Chaotic Good does, and here I am.

i was with her since pretty much freshman year. i'm gonna be a senior. same major, same small campus, i'm going to see her every fucking day.  i can't go through this pain anymore.

every fucking night for the past 3 months i think about her having sex with this guy she's been on a couple dates with.  every fucking night i can't sleep because that's all i think about.

everything just seems like a lie and i can't live a lie anymore.

Skip to yesterday, I am over with a friends house and I have been texting with this girl I have had a crush on for a while.

I thought this could be a perfect time for me to just shoot my shot, and try to improve from this situation. Anyway, I asked her and she freaked out and got really embarrased.

I have been in relationships before, but niether really count as they were just 2 flings. I'm familiar with the relationship drama in our class and know that she broke up with another guy a few months ago. That wasn't really a relationship either, as the person who asked her never did much, and didn't treat her with much respect. I really know how great a person she is and I have been so happy recently! I really want to have fun with her, and know that I will not just leave this as a fling.

My best friend has known since we met that I suffer with really bad mental health problems, he knows I have self harmed in the past and knows that I’ve really been struggling lately. 
He’s been away for just over a week I believe, so we’ve not spoke as much or seen each other however I have told him every day of my increasing issues, low mood and wanting to not be here anymore. 
Last night I finally said that I may ring for help today, he offered to ring me and I politely said no, explaining that I’ll just cry and work myself up more. After venting some more then over text message I got “just ring tomorrow then” 
I just told you I couldn’t do this anymore, I’ve spoke about not wanting to be here for over two weeks now, and as my best friend that’s all you say? I feel like I shouldn’t be angry because I shouldn’t expect so much, but I recently helped him through a very tough patch, and now it just seems like when I need help no one is there. 
I don’t know what I’m going to do, I’ve told him I won’t bother him with my issues anymore.

3182,"I dont know how to get helpIve been struggling really hard recently. Im missing half the school days becaude i dont want to get up, and when i am at school all i can think about it how much better it would be if I was asleep or dead, or how much the people around wouldnt care if I wasnt there anymore. I tried last on dec 17 and it didnt work my parents never found out, i took the day after off and on the 19th  i went to school. 

Doing anything productive makes me feel like dying. Its like my head is constantly just telling me to put myself out of my misery. I dont want to be here anymore, and at this point i dont know if I mean the town, the school, the state or even the world. I want to be somewhere else, but I dont want to die. Its starting to feel like the last place i can turn to. Its so exhausting hiding it and doing the things that are constantly making me feel like i should be dead. 

I dont know how to get help. I'm not close with my parents. They dont understand how serious my issues are, when I was first diagnosed with anxiety i was sent to one therapy session, and then when the next one was scheduled, they never took me. Last march i mentioned my anxiety again and my dads response to help was ""just talk to people"" so i dont see them as an option. When I was around 8 or 9 my older sister tried to kill herself, and thats when they took her to therapy, not after she asked and asked. 

Last week my school faced the reality of an old classmate comitting suicide, there wasnt much talk about it, a few Snapchat stories, no assembly or offers to help any students who may have been greiving, or even any help to prevent other students from trying. I didnt know this kid, but it was an eye opener seeing the path i was setting up for myself. The scary thing is that it didnt push me farther, it made me want to hurry up the process and get it over with, like the lack of offers to change was just a clear path to escape. Like even if I got caught, i wouldnt be talked to about it. 

I'm so scared of confrontation, i hate serious situations, i dont know how to get out. I dont want to be here anymore and i don't know what to do except jump the gun and swallow the pills. 

Sometimes im okay. Sometimes, like now, its really hard to resist. Other times ive got 3 pill bottles in front of me and the only thing stopping me is procrastination. Im okay for tonight, im going to sleep, the only thing ive taken is melotonin so I can sleep, but its just getting harder and harder to keep myself alive. Please help me find some way out of this.

3199,"I've become comfortable with the feeling of the inevitable. Now I'm concerned.I haven't planned on posting anything on this, and this isn't something that I would normally do at all. This is all going to sound very rough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I was about 12 I had thoughts about suicide, I was severely depressed and it became the norm for me to think about it daily - although I never planned on acting on it, then. Through the years my periods of depression came and went, sometimes for a month and once or twice for a full year (2012, 2016). Do to the fact I would think about this so often, it had normalised it in my head - or only now do I realised I normalised it. The past few months have been particularly bad for me. I've lost my job that I loved, have had to move out from my flat back to my parents and been diagnosed with ADHD. And I'm finding it really fucking difficult to find a job, or at least one that is as creatively fulfilling (I'm a designer). I've been processing a lot of things recently - and have been thinking about it a lot - not with any intention. It's now affecting me in my day-to-day - I find it really hard to find motivation because at the back of my head I feel like thats where it could end up, its inevitable, its been staring at me running through my mind for all these years and I just never acknowledged it so.   


Ontop of that, something changed last night. I had been thinking about it alot before I go sleep, I cant seem to help it it just happens. I have always processed it alot, but not with any intention. Last night when I was lying in bed, it was like a wave or something and I dont know what happened but all of a sudden I became completely comfortable with it. Like, 100%.   


I don't plan on acting on it, but I'm finding it really hard to shift this 'inevitability' from front of mind. And **that** scares me.   


Does any one else get this, lifetime bombardment of thoughts and fear of in the inevitable? Is this fucking normal?

I've had the urge to kill myself for a couple years now. It's just that recently the idea pops up in my head more often. 

I feel like my whole life I've been abandoned, my parents, friends, and others have left me in the dust for something better. I've had girls tell me they love me, think I'm perfect, and want to be with me. But they'll date someone else while leading me on. It's come to the point that I'm desensitized to things like that. I don't think I can love someone without worrying it's going to end abruptly. 

It's just that sometimes I'll think 'hmm, oblivion, no emotions, no pain, peace.' And I'll contemplate just killing myself. I mean, once I'm dead I won't have to worry about anything. I'll be free. Nothing to cause me pain. 

So, yeah, I guess you could call me suicidal. I see no happy future for me, and all my happy memories have something bad attached.

3204,"Repost from today's post (mistake caused trouble)Note: I reposted this so you guys can give me advice how to deal in this kind of situation. What I can expect from the police and what I can do to defend myself in case she sues me. 

From here on is my previous post, after this comes the edit.

""We have met in a game only about a week ago and I already know a lot about you. You are depressed and suicidal, the things you went through must be unbearable. We have been talking on snapchat and you were telling me things that really made me sad. I sometimes bug you and call you to make sure you are alright and spam you but that's only because I care. Yesterday at night I wrote to you for the last time as I didn't get any response anymore after calling and messaging several times. Today I really got anxious and took action. I live in another country but I still took measures and called the institutions you said you were going to. I even called your school and the police. Sadly they wouldn't tell me if you were alright or not because of security reasons. I kept calling your school and they told me if I called one more time I would get reported. I called the police and they told me they'd send a unit to your school to make sure you were ok. About an hour/1,5  ago I saw your snapchat location showed you were online at that moment. I still try to reach for you. And I am very sorry if I vexed you and caused you trouble. The police told me they would contact your parents, and I know your father is an asshole and tells you to kill yourself, so I hope he didn't flip out or anything. I wanted to come visit you in London but you refused and didn't feeI comfortable with it which is understandable, I asked for your phone number you didn't give it for the same reason. But thank god I know your first name and I knew which school you are going to, I dug and found your surname as well, and gave it to the police. I  just hope everything is alright and may god be with you. Don't leave me please, I am dying from inside...""

Edit: she screenrecorded our snapchat conversation and blocked me. My guess is that she is going to report me to the cops, my selfie was there too. Did I bring myself in danger? Will this have a bad end for me?

I usually am on the other end of these things begging strangers to change theit habits meditate, read some books, stop thinking negatively, pick up an instrument, exercise, ect ect... Today is different though, I have found a problem for which there is no contingency. 

I have been depressed for years, since I was 10 years old. I was a isolated angry child. In high school I was an akward pariah with a bad reputation. Through out most of my childhood I have been bullied or been involved in horrible one sided relationships. Toward the end of junior year things started to turn around for me. I was making real friendships, and I had a social life.

About a year ago my most recent bought of anxiety and depression started. My main group of friends blew up when an argument between me and a friend horribly escalated. Nobody really talks anymore and it made me look pretty terrible to say the least. Soon after that I noticed one of my oldest friends was sociopathic. He lied to me on multiple occasions, wether it be telling me the girl I was talking to was a lesbian or when he snitched another friend out ruining his life to keep himself out of trouble. When I confided in him he would use it as ammunition in later arguments. ""This is why everyone hates you"", he knew how paranoid I was about that type of shit. One day he was on Xanax driving stuffing his face with McDonald's. I pleaded with him to pay attention but they were met with insults. He almost wreaked, and after that I kicked him out of my life. He than told everyone I was unstable, and since I stayed bitter while he cleaned up his act. He stopped pissing everyone off and dug in his heels while I tried to convince a few other something was wrong. ""That's just how he is, he's just a dick sometimes"", needless to say I lost to his manipulation. I can see on Instagram and snapchat how much fun they have without me. I don't really have my friends from high school between these two incidents my reputation has been severely damaged. Now at work I am getting a reputation for being a weirdo. It's getting harder and harder to communicate with others, and I can hear the part-timers in particular openly talking shit. 

My brother and I were discussing how bad things have gotten. He tells me my only option is to restart find completely new friends and a new job. It's that or be ignored by everyone who I thought was my friend and be stuck in a workplace that's beginning to feel a lot like high school.

oh and today is my 17 birthday (no parties no friends no presents no happiness) and all i can do is think of how crappy my life is and how much i want too end it, i want the pain to go away.

i could go on about how pathetic my existence is, but it is to much to write in one post.


Happy birthday to me........right?

3237,"Everything has fallen apartI just can’t do this anymore, my mental state has been getting constantly worse to the point where I’m almost constantly thinking about ending my own life, worst part is because my friends knew about it but I can’t ask for help directly they cut contact for a month leaving me to suffer.

Today when I was already feeling more suicidal than normal my friend was getting into it but when I explained why I can’t make myself ask for help he blocked me :)

He was one of my few friends, and since this is what happened last time, the others probably hate me too, they’d be better off without me anyway.

3251,"Lost my job, the closest thing I've had to a girlfriend and my last shred of confidence...For the last few months I've been out of work on disability for depression which I've struggled with for the past 15 years (I spent a year and a half of high school in an outpatient program at a hospital, residential treatment centers, laundry lists of psychotropics...).  Last Thursday I had another meeting with my psychiatrist to finish the paperwork to extend my disability (already a month late) with a little assignment she had given me.  Because she had taken a month to complete the paperwork, my office sent a letter stating that if the disability claim wasn't worked out or if I didn't return to work by last Friday, I would be terminated.  So, when I show this letter to my doc, she tells me I should just go back to work and that she wouldn't sign anything else affirming my inability to function on the job.  

I went straight from the doc to a female friend's house who had just moved to the city a week before.  I had fallen in love with her in high school but then she started dating my best friend.  I held my tongue as long as I could but finally just had to tell her how I felt, making all of my friends think I was trying stab her boyfriend in the back.  So I was shunned by the bunch of them for a good year or so until the bf left the country.  However, throughout all of this I kept in touch with  the girl with whom I exchanged emails fairly regularly.  This was about seven years ago.  

We go get a bite to eat and when we get back to her place she's all over me, the most affection I've ever been fortunate to receive.  We keep out pants on, but that's about it.  I go home feeling on top of the world.  She has some obligations the next day, so I spend the time deep cleaning my apt, finally doing something productive.  The following day, we spend the whole day together, capped off with even heavier petting and repetitive proclamations of love from both of us (her first...).  

The next day, last Sunday, we were to see a concept together that we'd both been excited about for weeks and which she couldn't stop talking about.  About an hr before I went to pick her up, she sends a text saying she got strep throat and couldn't speak... I was a little suspicious, given the hours we spent in each others mouths the night before, but whatever, just wanted to do what I could to help her feel better.  No response, no response, no response.... must just be sleeping it off.

Finally, Monday night at around 11pm, after I'd flown to my parents' for the holidays, I get a text saying ""I want to be blunt, I have no romantic feelings for you.""  It was like I got the wind knocked out of me before I'd even taken my first breath...  She defriended me on face book, and hasn't responded to anything since.  What hurts/scares me the most is that this just makes me doubt even more my ability to understand people which has always been excruciatingly difficult.  

I don't have a job, I don't have any friends I can talk to in my city, have an incredible difficulty speaking to those elsewhere, and those that I'm closest to are in the process of kicking heroin...   Every girl/woman I've ever been interested in has either completely blown me off or led me on for months/years (multiple ""I love yous,"" always conditional.  Either just over a breakup and ""need some time"" or ""just not in *that* way).  And every time just hurts more...

It's been 15 years of people saying it will get better, and it will momentarily, but every time I fall, I fall farther and harder.  And after going through the psychology/psychiatry circuit for so long I've haven't heard anything new in a long fucking time...  Not to mention that the therapist I bonded most with and helped shape my view of the world, who I saw for 10 years, had a breakdown himself and no one (knew his friends/family by the end) has heard from in a few years.  He was last seen being released from the psych ward.  And the psychiatrist I bonded most with (4 years) had a breakdown too and stopped practicing.  

I've become more and more closed off from new therapists, always downplaying suicidal thoughts because I don't want to committed, and if I really do want to die I don't want them stopping me.  Even when I do open up I just get the same things I've heard for fucking years...  

The thought of hurting my family which has been so supportive my whole life is the only thing that has prevented me, but even that is meaning less to me as the days go by...

I don't really know why I'm posting here... 

tl;dr: 15 years of depression, forever alone, lost job, teased with a relationship, shunned, no local friends, out-of-town friends have their own issues namely heroin....

3269,"Suicide, and it's cowardice. Or is it?Much like the rest of the world, I live with the thoughts of suicide, day in and out. I hear on a regular basis (local folk, not on the internet), that suicide is a coward's method, that it is 'taking the easy way out' instead of solving the problem.

Still, I'd rather face the sweet embrace and chill of the afterlife than live with the obsessive, and quite frankly, creepy behaviour that I can't seem to be rid of.

I've driven all my friends away, save the select few I've known for years. I've distanced myself from family, and I live with the consistent guilt from an event that happened years ago that I can't let go of until I'm forgiven by whom I'd hurt. 

Suicide, and for that matter, any death, is not 'the easy way out', because it's enduring one final pain to make the rest stop. Those of us who have been driven over that border do not fear the great darkness, we embrace it. While it brings sorrow to our families, they get over it, just like the rest of the problems they face.

We're remembered for the positives, not for the negatives. And, I think that counts for something. It's not cowardice that drives is to that point. It's one final breath of courage.

Much like many other members of my family, I'm sure that one day I will join the great darkness. Fit now though, I have my obsession to keep me alive, and people I must care for.",suicide

All the way up until I left for college, I was filled with sadness, rage and hate, hate for myself. I cut myself a lot in high school, because I hate who I am and hurting myself felt right. The scars are still very visible even today. 


All of those feelings finally faded after I met her. She wasn't the first person I loved, but she was the first one who TRULY loved me back, and was really good to me. Just a few weeks after we started dating we cried in each other's arms because we were so happy together, so happy to find someone good in this world.


She is my world, she's the only thing in my life that made me want to live, and for the past 4 years I have lived, just so I could be with the one person who helped me to finally be happy. She's everything to me, and I know in my heart there's no one else out there who could be as wonderful as her.


Today, Nov 5, would have been our 4 year anniversary. Wednesday of last week, on the 1st, she left me while I was at work. I never saw it coming, but I came home to find the door unlocked, all of her things gone, and a note saying goodbye. She never talked to me about any problems in our relationship, if she had I would have done anything to make it right, anything to make her as happy as possible, but I didn't know. We never fought, never argued, just love, so much damned love that I thought I was in a dream.


Her note said she resented me for my procrastination, and that I didn't share enough of her interests. The things she noted I would have gladly went out to do with her, if she'd only talked with me things could have been even better for us both. I loved going on dates with her, money has just been tight the past few months after we moved, and she didn't give us a chance to get back on our feet to do nice things again.


I gathered from her note that she has gone back to her ex, the one person that has a truck, the one person who I've not gotten a response from. I trusted her to talk to him online because it was a group chat with all of their friends in it. I trusted her to go on a week vacation with all of those friends, including him, because I thought she truly loved me all these years and would never betray that trust. 


When she came back, she acted a little different. At first I thought she was adjusting to coming back home. I finally asked her what was wrong but she said everything was fine. Not wanting to push I thought I'd let her talk to me when she was ready. Now she's gone and I've heard nothing from her since.


I haven't eaten since she left, I can't sleep well if even at all, I had panic attacks in my sleep a couple of nights ago. I'm back in the darkness that I thought I'd escaped years ago. I hate myself for losing the one person who was good to me. I hate myself for not being what she wanted. I want to die so I don't have to feel this pain anymore, so I don't have to be without her. She took her guns so I would have to do it painfully with a knife. It would hurt, but I don't even care about that, I deserve the pain because of this self hatred that I can't suppress.


There's only one thing that holds me back. My little brother died at age 17 this year in May. Losing him hurt us all, most of all my mother. I love her, she's a loving mother and I don't want to put her through losing both sons in the same year. However, at the same time I feel like after all these years of pain I deserve to be selfish just one final time. I feel like everyone should understand that I deserve to end my pain and misery. I've been so good to my lovers and they always hurt me deeply, this one being the worst pain I've ever felt, because I truly felt in my heart that she was the one.


Would my mother, my family understand this? Could they forgive me for wanting to be free of the pain? I don't want them to feel guilty, like there was anything they could do. It's just me, there's something wrong inside of me, and I can't cope with it anymore. My love was the one person who took the pain away, without her I can't take it. It's all come back in a rush of agony and hurt. I'm only 24, and imagining dealing with this misery until I die of natural causes is too much, I can't bear the thought of it. I just hope that telling people who might understand these things, that I can't tell my family, might help.

3366,"Questions about SuicideSo I've been considering suicide, I have a history of that shit. I'm in a bad depression. I don't know why I'm thinking of suicide. I'm bipolar, so I know this is all bound to end, rather soon, soon being probably in 6 months at least. So it's not that I believe this is a never ending pain thing. But the depression really hurts and I'm scared I'm going to commit suicide. I don't want to actually die, I want to live and enjoy life. I don't want the ones I love to grieve, although I wish they would understand where I'm coming from, understood how bad things are. I go to work and just cry and it's so embarrassing. 

I feel like I can't trust myself. I'm afraid if I get in my car and drive I'm going to drive to where I where I want to commit it. I'm scared I'm going to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night when everyone is sleeping and commit it. I feel like I'm on the brink of doing that. I feel like this is the end and I can't imagine actually living another week or so. I feel like I want to do this and this is my destiny. I'm scared this is going to be one big impulse and I won't be able to take it back.

So I've been telling myself suicide is an active, conscious decision. It won't happen unless I decide to do it. So here are my questions, what if I /decide/ to do it, and go off to do it, how do I stop myself, what am I suppose to do? When people commit suicide, do they have a clear reason in their mind?

I see a therapist and psychiatrist. My pdoc just gave me a new anti depressant so I'm really hoping it works sooner rather than later. I do all they say to treat depression but it's not work. So yes I do exercise and all these different things a therapist would suggest. ",suicide

my parents are constantly fighting, afraid to go on winter break this year but i was failing my classes. my friends dont talk anymore because of the drama here, their parents wouldnt want them to come over. I have 10 siblings (one living with us, locks himself in his room) that don’t talk to me though i wish they did, give me advice for what to do or explain how they dealt with my parents. my mom is an alcoholic, at least once a week she’ll get nasty, call me names, says she’ll kill herself because she cant deal with us, hit me, etc. my dad will skip days off work because he cant get out of bed, incredibly down. hes an alcoholic as well, less functional when hes drunk but wouldnt hurt anybody. hes extremely sensitive and if someone looked at him a certain way or didnt reply to him or laugh at his jokes he’ll yell, say we dont love him or leave

an online friend ive had is honestly the only thing keeping me alive, i look forward to talking to them even though its incredibly awkward and starting to go downhill. its all i ever think about, and when theyre feeling down themselves i completely shut down. everything is so much more intense when theyre away or something is wrong over there. i know its not healthy to absolutely depend on someone else. im having a lot of trouble finding new friends and sharing the love to multiple people. im terribly shy and insecure, if i think i did something wrong ill go on an apologizing rampage and bash myself in chat and ruin the atmosphere. and then ill say sorry for that too. ill go away for weeks because i think i deserve it and that they would want me to. come back and apologize because id worried them, feel awful. similar to what my dad does.l

theyve been having a lot of trouble on their half as well, itd be another paragraph to explain it though. weve been exchanging vents but its only tearing us two apart, and we know it. weve gone over it, started over, a million times. if they go i will too

i know i have to look ahead to ever get through it, but right now i dont know if I even see a future at all. and i know there are countless people going through unimaginable situations, feels so selfish to even vent. i believe that if youre your top priority, youll take care of yourself no matter what environment youre in. but if youre not, youre just gonna bully yourself no matter where you go. idk how to move forward, ive tried so many times, i can predict how people try to help, twist it around and make it negative

it feels so pointless, i ask them if they want to talk, they say “i do” when were both aware that it will fall again, we’ll hurt ourselves again, shit will happen over and over.  but i cant leave it, nor can i leave this house. even if i got away its still in my head, im stuck forever unless i go. everyday i go to school itching to go home to hurt myself, unless my friend is happy then i am. so mad at myself feel like ican do anything",suicide

3381,"I don’t have an interesting titleThis is really long btw. So if nobody reads it I understand

I don’t even know how to start this off. I’m just in so much pain. My mind has become my prison. I have so much self hatred. I’m also self destructive. 

I moved halfway across the country after high school cause I thought it’d make me happy. Start new and leave all the negative behind. Move in with my dad and start working full time. I eventually move out to my own place. I was so unhappy about my job. I would also feel embarrassed to tell people where I worked. 

So my new mission was to find a better job. Family member hooked me up with a really great job. For a 21 year old kid with no degree this job was great. I was prob making too much money for someone my age lol. A lot of dumb spending and lots of drunk nights. 

The job really did help me out. I use to live in this duplex that had nasty carpet. I had no furniture and I had no plates or anything of that nature. Just my bedroom stuff, one entertainment center with a tv in my living room, and some rickety old stained blue recliner. 

Eventually I put down wood floors and furnished my entire place from top to bottom in a matter of months. I even opened up a good credit card and started building my credit. Was the first time in my life I was able to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck. Lol I even had a health savings account that later paid to have my wisdom teeth removed. I really went far and I was proud of myself for once. 

It just wasn’t enough though. I was still in so much pain. A job I loved turned into a job I loathed. I think I was genuinely happy for a couple months max. I ended up working there for two years and some change. 

I left when I decided I should go to school. I’m in a town with a great school and my family has gone to this school for generations. So I put in a month notice at my job and started taking steps to get myself ready for the college life. 

My first semester was a breath of fresh air. I loved it. I loved going to class and doing something I actually wanted to do. That lasted for a whole semester and a minimester. My next full semester? I almost failed this semester. I was very close to getting out on academic suspension. I stopped going to class halfway through. I don’t even know if I want to do it anymore.

I’m just running in circles. I think something will be good for me and I go and do it. It helps for s couple of months then I’m back to square one. The amount of hate I have for myself in just ridiculous. I don’t think I hate anything even remotely close tot he way I hate myself. 

At my school getting your ring is a big deal. Man I cannot fucking wait to get it either. But after I get it then what? Will it really make me happy?What happens when I finish my degree? Will I be happy then? Will I want more? What happens when I get a job I want? Will that be the turning point? Nothing is enough for me. It just keeps going. It’s a never ending pursuit of nothing. Fucking nothing. 

I’m visiting my friends in another state right now. 
Reconnected with an old friend. (Not the one I’m staying with). Things went well and things kind of flames out. Wasn’t good. This year comes around and things actually go through. She was very standoffish though after we were with each other the first night. I thought maybe I did something wrong. She continued to be short with me the next day. Then I went and got hammered for the football game and sent some dumb ass drunk texts and I think I’ve really fucked it up now. She didn’t even want to talk to me the next day after.

We are suppose to do something tonight for New Years. However, I feel that won’t go through. I just went a fucked it all up with some stupid drunk texts man. 

I just can’t get a win and if I do get a win it helps me out for a month. 

I’m a hypocrite, a liar, selfish, and just about everything else. I’m just out here dying and I’m getting closer everyday to just saying “fuck it”. I just don’t know how much more I can take. I’ve been dealing with since this I was 15. I just didn’t know what I was when I was that young.

A coworker of mine has struggled with depression for a long time (I believe at least a decade), but I have known him for only the last year and a half. He recently entered a relationship with a former coworker, and I'm not sure if she knows but I have never met her so it is not my place to let her know his current situation. The only reason I know he is suicidal is that he posted in here two months ago and I recognized his username. 

Because I'm not his girlfriend and we do not interact on a daily basis, I don't know how to show my support without seeming awkward or intrusive. He plays a major role in the restaurant we both work in, but this has clearly had a major impact on his mental health. 

Everyone's mental health is different. What works for one person (i.e., medication, therapy, support) may not work for another.

I'll only tell you some basic facts about me, only because you don't need my life story. I'm drunk right now so I'm sorry if I make any typing or grammar mistakes:

First off, as I just mentioned, I'm drunk. This is an issue because I'm underage, in fact I'm not even an adult. It isn't that I'm going out to parties to get drunk, in fact it's the opposite. The people who are supposed to love me the most and protect me are my enablers, my parents, who have drank before and after my birth for as long as I have been able to remember. I'm the last child, the youngest, so I am a victim and a product of dealing with my parents who are at the age of where they don't give a fuck anymore. My dad is a reserved, quiet, nice man. He brings home the bread and that keeps him happy, aside from his booze. My mother is the polar opposite, jobless, a ""stay-at-home"" mom, suffering from a disease that makes her head feel like she's been spun around in a tornado and then let go. She's loud, gets angry easily, and makes my life more miserable than I'd like. She's also one of the most emotional and passionate people I've ever met and I love her. She's lost a son before and that's been one of the reasons I haven't offed myself yet.

Tonight, we had our weekend tradition. Get drunk, play games, listen to music, chill, and talk. During the play games session (I get very upset over games, I got my short temper from my mother) I got angry at my mother for how she was playing the game, she started to yell at me, I threw my cards at her, almost broke my bottle from slamming it, and retreated to my computer. No one has spoken to me since. 

Since they are asleep, I began going through the medicine cabinet and I began looking at medicine in there. Googling the overdose effects and seeing how long it would take to kill me. Nothing I found interested me, most of them would kill me in 70+ hours after tons of pain and suffering, which isn't what I want. Hanging myself seems too awful, every time I think of it I picture the screams of whoever finds me, and I don't want to do that to someone.

But now I think im ready and I think I've found my way out. 

Context to this situation is Im a 20 y/o gay male and the only friend I have is my ex boyfriend, he's now found his way into another relationship, im happy for him, but in this sense ive lost my friend because he doesn't want to hurt his partner by just participating in idle chat with me. With everything else happening in my life, losing the one person I talk to sent me to have a mental break and I sat crying in front of my ex after he had told me that he can't talk to me any more, I cried and couldn't even make sense of what i was saying, what pained me the most is that he looked at me as if I was insane. There was just alot of me crying because I had lost my friend (at this point he wasn't someone I though of as my ex partner, he was just my best friend) he drove me home and couldn't help but just sit in silence. As I hopped out of the car I said the main things that i enjoyed about when I saw him but I ended the conversation with ""thank you, I love you like family, and I'm sorry"" with little tears in my eyes I let out a gentle smile (this would probably be the last time I see him). I few days have passed since then and I've taken it upon myself to voluntarily refuse water and food in hopes of having a death im comfortable with.

I'm 26 In  a few months and I barely have any friends, the ones I do I rarely ever get to see. I got fired a month ago because I blew up on management for the constant shitty treatment they gave me every day and so they kicked me out and banned me from the property and since then I havent found a full time job no matter how hard I try. I never had a proper girlfriend so I dont even know what it's like to hold hands with a female while other people my age i went to school with have went to college, found great jobs, and started a family. My health has also deteriorated as I have untreated obstructive sleep apnea so I cant breathe for shit when I try to sleep so I'm constantly tired even if I sleep for 12 hours(usually consists of me waking up briefly every 2 or so hours). I cant fucking afford the machine to help because my moms insurance doesnt cover it all (cant even afford my own health insurance or car insurance I have to rely on my mom for everything because of how much a failure I am). I have severe social anxiety so anything I try to do that involves going somewhere or doing something new I get so nervous and freak out I usually just go back home and sit in my room. The last time I truly remember being happy was when I was a kid. Its only gone downhill since I graduated high school 8 years ago. The only thing that even makes me slightly smile anymore is my dog, but with her health (over weight blind diabetic and being a pug has respiratory issues) she wont be around forever since she has all that and is already 10.

3416,"My ""life"" ended a long time agoI'm posting here because I'm for the most part done with living. Life has nothing to offer me. Never has. 

First, I'm going to describe myself so those who will be turned off by talking with someone like me will know up front.

I'm 5'3"", about 150, 55 years old, medium-brown skinned female, short small nose, a jutted jaw with thin lips, sunken eyes, a metal hip and cataracts. Face looks flat from the side and people have called me ""retard"" or ""Down syndrome"" because of it. I might actually have something wrong with me genetically. I've always had poor muscle tone. So there, I'm ugly, and on top of that, I'm probably a narcissist with schizoid affective disorder, have been hospitalized in medical and mental institutions more than 15 times. I was assaulted in one of the mental institutions. 

I have never stopped thinking of committing suicide. I think about it every single day, have done so since my early teens. I was almost successful back in 2011. Worst day ever for the entire world. I should have died then, at least.

Not one person on this earth is compatible with me. Several people have said to me, ""Don't nobody want you,"" and they have been right. Even the guy I was married to and divorced didn't like me for anything but as much money he could spend. I can't think of one family member with whom I've been close. I'm a burden to them all, and that number has always been around five or less.

So, for all of my life, I've been pushed off on people whose job it was to ""provide services"" to me. Now, even those people don't want the job.

So what's left?

The sooner I'm outta here, the less of a burden I will be, and the better off the world will be.",suicide

My toxic family has always hated me and they're blaming me for my declining health. My psycho dad always threatened to kill me since I was a toddler. My mother doesn't give two fucks about me and never has. Instead she worships the abusive cunt she married.

When I was younger I was full of hope that my life would change. It did but not in the way I expected. IT GOT MUCH WORSE. My fucking disease is killing me. No cure. The universe has been mocking me and shitting on me since the day I was born.

3421,"A Substitute Teacher's View on False Accusations First off, I'm 27, so I'm definitely outside the intended audience here, but a thread from this sub came up on /r/all of someone very upset that their favorite teacher and mentor was getting fired unfairly. I wanted to chime in with some thoughts from my perspective as someone who's had the pleasure of substitute teaching over the course of a couple years in a bunch of different schools in California. 

I've certainly encountered students behaving extremely inappropriately, and I've even had a troubled student or two joke about reporting me for things they made up. It is, on a personal level, really icky and kinda scary, but you put on your blank face, remind them to focus on that math problem, and move on. Educators have a lot on their side. Often too much so. Staff is pretty fundamentally almost always going to side with teachers over students. It is not easy at all to get a teacher fired, or even to get a school to stop bringing in a particularly bad substitute. Furthermore, educators have it drilled into them how to behave appropriately with students, which includes keeping things public and keeping contact with students outside of school limited and professional. This is for the safety and wellbeing of everyone, and as long as a teacher is following standard practices and not straying off the path, it's very unlikely for any sort of false accusations to get them fired. 

If a teacher is getting fired, there's probably really strong evidence of utterly unacceptable behavior, and it's also likely a pattern of behavior. Anything less, and the default attitude of many people is that the person saying something is lying.  


In any case where the facts are in doubt, well, schools have a lot of reasons to prefer sweeping things under the rug. A fired teacher is a big deal, it makes waves. A broken hearted or troubled student being lectured to stop lying, just being ignored or patronized, or being sent off to a different school is all sadly normal. If a school is actually taking action on students' reports of harassment, there's probably a lot more to it than you might think, or than what you really have a right to know about.   


I get feeling defensive of favorite teachers. I can tell you that teachers appreciate it. But that feeling is from your experience with that teacher, and other students have their own experiences. Just as you show different sides of yourself with different people, that teacher may behave very differently with someone else. If they did do something horribly wrong to someone else, well if history class teaches anything it's meant to be that people are complicated and that even national heroes can also do monstrous things. Part of growing up is coming to terms with those things and not letting them make you suspect the worst of people.  


Speaking of which, do cabals of students conspire to fabricate evidence and successfully get teachers fired for funsies? I expect it's happened. Cabals of students have literally murdered people. But it is not **normal**. It is in fact very **rare**. If a teacher is fired at your school (for non-budget reasons), however great they were to you, they very likely stepped way out of line with someone else. And if they did that with one kid, they probably did it with others who didn't say anything.   


As serious as false accusations are, and they should never be made, real abuse is far more serious in the harm that it does. Please don't rush to judgement, especially not of your peers. It's okay to not have a strong opinion on something you've heard about second hand.   


If you have experienced someone behaving inappropriately towards you, please tell an adult that you trust, and/or take a leap of faith on someone who works for your school. All education staff are mandated reporters and you **will** find someone who will be on your side if you open up. If you're in California, students can file complaints on educator misconduct online here: [https://www.ctc.ca.gov/educator-discipline/public](https://www.ctc.ca.gov/educator-discipline/public)",non-suicide
3423,"Literally impossible for me to turn my life aroundI'm transgender. Been on hormones for 3 years almost.

I've worked out fashion choices, gotten good at makeup and have a good haircut and a so-so voice. But I can't pass to anyone. I'm just treated or assumed to be a femme gay guy no matter what I do. I regularly get stares, comments (made loud enough for me to hear), laughter, glares, sometimes slurs, sometimes people following me, passive-aggressively shitty service in most businesses I go to and taken advantage of guys who know that I'll sleep with them if they lie to me and tell me I'm pretty. Facial feminization surgery is $20k at least and with my shitty field choice I won't be making that any time soon. Plus, I suspect the surgery won't have that much effect on me as I've seen results and the changes are usually subtle i.e. pushing someone from andro to femme not from masculine to femme, so i'm fucked regardless. Also I'm sterile from the hormones. 

I know it's easy to tell people to just keep trucking and just keep going and to just not care what other people think, but let's be real if you were dehumanized every day no matter where you went your mental health would be pretty shitty too right? And this is in a liberal city so i don't have anywhere to escape to.

3434,Life’s not worth it anymoreHi so today I decided that within the next week I will kill myself. I came to this choice after my best friend slept with the girl I love last night. This is not the only reason but it’s the one that finally broke me. I’m an unattractive guy. And my biggest fear is never finding someone to actually have a connection with. I had a connection once with a girl in highschool with me but she was very abusive. She like to cut me with knives because it gave her pleasure. I was in a relationship with her for four years until I went to college and that was 3 years ago. I have problems with girls because of this relationship and I never can find an outlet to voice my pain because I’m a guy and guys just can’t do that shit. At least that’s how I was raised. So you see with this last straw and everything else I just don’t feel like any of this is at all worth it anymore. Why live when for 3 years all I felt was pain/mistrust to people.

Sometimes I dream of my home with all these extra corridors and rooms and doorways into other realms and I wake up and lay in bed for hours thinking about those places until I realize that they don't actually exist. Its not surprising, Everyday its the same thing, I wake up and just zone out until I have somewhere to be like school. Hours pass me by, often I can't even remember what I've done with the time, I'm there in my head thinking about my life and certain aspects, always thinking but never really there in the moment. I think my grasp of reality is fading, I have very little social contact with the rest of the world. Its like I'm watching my dull life as a movie now and not really living it. I don't have any friends and my family, though me and my brothers are close, seem to maintain an unspoken agreement that we should never talk about our emotions. 

My parents act like drones too, its like I don't even know who they are, all they do is watch TV all day and occasionally when times are tough they make it obvious that they hate this position their in with having spent their lives raising kids though it doesn't really bother me anymore I don't think I ever needed their acceptance I just hope they don't ever expect me to take care of them in their old age as I don't feel anything for them. Though no one wants to know as a child that their parent's are done actually caring for their children by the time they're born like they're just another item off the assembly line. As a child I always felt old, a thousand years old, not being able to relate to anyone my age, just watching and observing as if I didn't belong there at all.

I don't think I've ever felt love or cared for any other human in my life. For a short time me and this girl in high-school who I was good friends with were having sex without any actually relationship(she like weird guys and I filled the requirements) and then she suddenly cut it off, she thought I was boring and I suspect also because I was atrocious at sex. When me and her were having sex I couldn't help but think of how ridiculous the reality of the situation was, how bizarre and over romanticized the act of sex was and it was hindering my performance when all I wanted to do was enjoy myself. So the only person who has ever reached out to me for a relationship thinks I'm worthless, its left me feeling pretty unmotivated to look for a girlfriend. I look into peoples eyes and they don't seem human, they're cold and calculated and often even predictable and I often think of how little It would make a difference to me if I were the only human left on the planet, it actually seems like a really nice idea as I could go anywhere I want, I feel trapped now, this house is a cage.

Its not that I don't think people aren't capable of emotions like I am its just that I feel like I would have to wade through millions of them before I could find one that was actually sentient, everyone seems so sadistic, they always have someone they hate, I don't want to hate anyone and I don't understand why everyone wants to cause so much needless drama in their life. How can people who act so sadistic be human like I am? Sometimes I get so caught up with these pondering that I forget where I am, sometimes I get so made thinking about a point in my life when someone was being unfeeling and cruel to me that I punch the air as if I were really there thinking about how it doesn't matter if they get hurt because they can't possibly be human and want to cause such pain for no reason.

 I don't think I have the guts to finish myself off as its always been a reassuring feeling ever since I was a little boy, if I had a more convenient way like a gun or a pill I wouldn't hesitate.

That I will eventually take hold of my future, and aspire to do something meaningful. Can I say I've given it my all? No. Well, at the very least, have I felt satisfied in the few instances I've become invested in a certain task or something similar? No, whenever I've attempted something like maintaining a job, or increasing my GPA, I've always failed on some level. I've become so comfortable with keeping to myself that I struggle with relationships at the most basic level. I go into passive mode and just fall out of touch with those around me. Any job that requires effective communication like facing customers and putting on a smile, I flounder. I come off as some kind of socially inept weirdo on the fringe of being considered mentally handicapped. I've been openly mocked by past fellow employees, and I don't fault them for it.

Victim of years of abuse. Years. I won't go into specifics because some folks are sensitive to that. From 10-16 or so.

Met a girl, settled down and got married. Things were ok for a while, I started to change according to my wife. So I told her everything. Everything. She handled it as well as could be expected and suggested therapy. Which I took. I felt no better but took it anyways.

Spent years in therapy, with no change. Found out through people that several of my numerous abusers were dead, I felt sad.

I was depressed all the time, no answer, no help. Turned away from suicide lines in Can/US because they don't help straight white men, programs for lgbt, poc and youth, but not adult men. Not here to gripe, just matter of fact.

On a work trip, I had to pull over at a rest stop to make use of the facilities, and there was another man in there, pleasuring himself. I watched for a while before getting involved (stupidly) When it was over, it felt like a weight had lifted off of me. My depression cleared.

My wife noticed the change when I got home too. I didn't tell her why. We made love for the first time in over 6 months. I never lost attraction for her just function.

Cut to two weeks later, the depression is back. And with a vengeance. I'm out for a walk trying to clear my head and shake the darkness free in nature, when I stumble upon a group of men being intimate with each other. Again I watch from the sidelines, then again I join in. Then again I feel better.

I have zero attraction to any of these men, or really any other men for that matter.  It for some reason this action, this fulfillment of some sort of trauma bond, makes me feel better for short times.

I've always been safe about it, but I can't keep leading this double life. 

I've gone without that sort of contact for 4 weeks now and I'm staring very worryingly at firearms, ropes and such.

3477,"Constant suicidal ideationSo this isn't a new problem, I've been like this for as long as I can remember. Every day I wake up and wish I had died in my sleep, sat at work ( like now ) I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up, the same thoughts are there all day every day, driving to work or coming home, seeing my 'friends', doing fun stuff, etc.

It's just constant and never ending. I don't really have anything to be sad about or depressed about I just feel like I'm in mental pain all the bloody time.

A couple of years ago I was taken under the care of a mental health crisis team and finally got to see a psychiatrist, after a few assessments the conclusion was that I have a depressive personality disorder and that it's unlikely to respond to medication (of which I've tried a lot).

This has ultimately destroyed every aspect of my life. I lost the woman I love, the one person who somewhat soothed the pain, because I couldn't commit after 7 years together mostly because I felt like there was no point when I know I'm only going to kill myself. I really wanted to be with her, marry her and spend my life with her but this overwhelming desire to die to overroad everything else.

Despite all this I'm fairly successful in business, I'm what most people consider very well off, but really this just hides whats going on under the surface.

I do occasionally talk to people about how I'm feeling, but almost nobody actually understands what I'm saying because they've never felt what I feel. I can't really talk to my best friend/ex now because she's moved on to somebody new, he's a nice guy I think and I'm glad that she's with somebody who will look after her because obviously I never could in the long run.

I'm not really looking for help, I don't know what I'm looking for, I just spend so much time hiding how I feel I just wanted to put it out there. My head hurts and I just wish we had an off switch.",suicide

1. Reincarnation-I sure as hell don't want to come back to this earth! But if I do, I suppose I could commit suicide again, but then I'd just come back to earth again and the cycle would keep repeating
2. Heaven-Even if heaven is ""great,"" it involves eternity, which let's be real-I don't want to live forever. I highly doubt I can commit suicide in heaven
3. Hell-There are many definitions as to what this can be, ranging from separation from God to fire and brimstone to merely the grave...but let's assume some sort of eternal torture, taking the worst case scenario....I highly doubt one can commit suicide in hell

And there are many versions of heavens, hells, what happens when we reincarnate, and plenty of other afterlife ""options,"" but the above are the main ones people argue these days. 
And that's why I can't kill myself. Because there is a chance that there is an afterlife, and there is a chance the afterlife sucks more than this life and there will be no escape..

Hopefully by then I'd've moved out from my parents' house. I'm CF and so I needn't worry about sticking around for any hypothetical children.

I just can't cope with this any more, and having a time limit — it makes things easier. I can't live in a system as restrictive, as rigid, as oppressive as this one. Nothing will change either, given that people — myself included — are too afraid to take a stand. 

There's too much suffering, and there's hardly anything to show for it. There's austerity and homelessness; domestic violence (against both men and women) and mental illnesses — and so many other issues I can't pinpoint from the top of my head.

My family will mourn, of course. 

I was never made for this world. I'm flimsy, talentless, and just below average looking. I'm a constant anxious, depressed, and incompetent mess.

3544,"What is wrong with me?I'm not someone who has ever had difficulty with people. I've had plenty of friends and girlfriends in my life, some of whom are still obsessed with me. I've always been good with people. I've never had an issue with getting people to care for me. I'm a sociable and endearing person. I'm fairly popular and well liked. 

And yet here I am. Constantly at a distance. Constantly at odds. I struggle with people because nobody seems as off centre as I do. Everyone laughs and thinks I'm joking when I talk about offing myself. They think it's another one of my jokes. But I think about it all the time. Every day, from the start the the end. I think about ending it. I've even blatantly told friends before, and nobody takes me seriously. 

I'm decently attractive and have never had an issue getting women to take an interest in me. And by all means, I'm pretty well off financially. But that makes it worse. Why? Because I've been successful, nobody takes my struggles seriously. It's just another one of my jokes. But I daydream about being dead. I constantly think about everything being done and finished. And not casually. It's all that fills my head. Every day. 

It just seems surreal sometimes. No matter how many people I meet and talk to, nobody seems to understand where I am in my life. Or what I'm trying to imply. I feel disconnected and distanced from people who think they understand me. I feel separate. I want to die. I think about it all the time. The world seems cheap. Nobody cares, and I don't expect them to. Everyone is disposable and self consumed, and I'm no exception. 

I drink almost constantly throughout the day. I do any drug I can get my hands on. It's never been because I like to ""party. It's because I want it to be over. I feel like I've been trying to hint about my issues through it, but nobody really pays much attention. Nobody cares. Nobody catches onto the fact that I'm deliberately trying to off myself in the most subtle way possible. Like maybe if I OD my family won't be as heartbroken. They'd see it as an accident. 

But no matter how many times I take too much, I survive. So I think about taking a more direct approach. And again, no matter how many times I talk about it, people think I'm just joking around. 

Recently I've been having chronic pain all over and have been treating it with heroin, alcohol, and whatever else seems to take my mind off of it. If it dulls me mentally, it helps. It doesn't hurt as much if I don't think. Nothing else seems to help it. I need that distraction or I'm full of aches and pain. 

I know that this is long but I don't know what else to say. I'm just so tired of being down. I'm tired of acting like nothing is wrong. I feel like I'm almost at a point where everything is unbearable. I dread waking up every day. I want everything to be done. I want to cross the street at the wrong time. All of that. The idea consumes me. I have a gun in my house, and it's all I can do to not use it. 

I can't avoid being consumed by whatever it is that holds me. I'm just done. I don't want to be in pain anymore or have people see my issues as as joke. I've spent more than enough time looking down the barrel of my own gun. Something has to give, in either direction.    

As it is, I'm more prepared for death than anything else. I live in a sort of fear of the night that I finally get carried away. Recently I've been spending most of my days sleeping and trying to isolate myself. I feel like I'm always getting closer, but part of me wants to avoid it. I feel like there's no excuse because there's plenty of people worse off than me, but it still stays on my mind every day. ",suicide

I can't stop thinking about suicide. My life as perhaps that of many others of us is not easy. I am a 20 year old male and I recently met a girl. Generally I can't open myself to others and tell my emotions and thoughts. I've spent the last two years destroying myself. I recently tried to get help from a psychologist but I gave up. I can't take it anymore every day that passes, life loses all meaning. I met a special girl recently and after talking for a long time I opened up and told her about my life. Unfortunately I returned home. We live in two different countries. We continue to talk daily but my thoughts about suicide do not pass. I feel like I feel something for her and I would work hard to stay together but I wonder if doing so will not make her suffer more. I need some advice should i gave up on her?",suicide

as someone who's been really enhancing my production, i wanted to do something for the sub, and something pretty cool. 

A public sample pool!

essentially, go comment a track you would love to see sampled in a beat. whether it's an old R&amp;B song, a Legend of Zelda song, a Marvel fighting skit, i'll do my best to check it out and see if I should use or incorporate it.  I'm planning a beat switch in it too so if you see me confirming a sample in the comments that's way different then your recommendation don't fret!

3564,"I can't do thisLife is getting too real for me too fast. I can't be the one to figure out how to pay the bills. I can't be my mother's caretaker. I can't lead this family unit in a direction that will keep us afloat. I just can't.

 I can't stay positive in the face of this much adversity. I can't be a part of figuring out real life solutions using real life knowledge and wisdom. I can't be a leader or even a part of this team, but what am I going to do? Abandon everyone? I can't do that, and I have nowhere else to go. 

I don't want to be the teacher of life skills that will get others through the harsh life that is ahead. I don't want the responsibility to teach them to rest on me. I don't want the responsibility to learn as much as I can and to work as hard as is necessary for us all to make it to rest on me. 

I also don't want to work in a team where all of these responsibilities have to be figured out and delegated and such. I can't do this. I'm not strong enough to do this. I just want to run away, but there is nowhere to run to. I don't want to be a part of the military. I just don't want to do what is absolutely necessary to make it. I don't even really want to figure out how to make it. Life has been too easy for too long. Now it feels like every little choice I make, how I spend every little second, is going to be the difference between making it and not making it. There is no ""things will naturally work out on their own."" That's not how this works. 

I don't see anyway out but through, but I don't want to go through. I don't want to suddenly become emotionally responsibile for my family. I don't want to be anyone's ""rock.""

I need to escape. I cannot handle the life which has been set before me. I cannot handle life as it is in general. I don't want to be a part of this mess. I can't be. I'm too used to coasting along, not worried about having my basic needs met, or having to take care of anyone, or having to teach anyone, or having to be emotionally responsibile to anyone.

But there is no way out. I have been able to think more clearly now due to better life choices than I've been able to for a very long time. The truth is, I am horribly immature. I'm just now figuring out who I am at 23. I'm constantly worrying about things that fucking teenagers handle way before they ever graduate high school. 

I don't want to embrace this journey. I don't want to look forward to an intense period of great personal growth and struggle. I can't handle the responsibility of it all. I've just been ignoring it for so long, desperately hoping my parents would be able to pull through of their own accord while I and my siblings get our shit together. There's no time for that anymore. There's no time for no taking anything seriously anymore. There is only time for the real life of learning and responsibilities that is set before us, and I can't do this. I can't even properly act like I've got everything under control like a real fucking mam for my own desperate mother. I can't do this. I've failed at becoming a real man, and now I'm backing away from the challenge. 

I don't know. So much of my time and mental energy is spent on things that just don't matter. Things I don't even really bother to understand, like politics, or watching topical shit on YouTube, which in the end I don't even really learn from. 

Life itself is far too great a thing for me to be able to deal with. To learn from experience is something I've really been struggling with, and now that I've quit weed and able to have more real forethought, everything I know that life
must be is too much. I very well may have just fried my brain. I don't want to keep on going. I don't know what to do. I just can't happily embrace what life is, now that I've become more clear in my mind. 

Life is too daunting to put my real mental
energy into living. I can't even take responsibility for holding myself emotionally accountable. I am too far gone.  I can't willingly grasp the real hardships of life. I've spent so long dissociated from reality, that it's become too much to handle now that I'm back. To just shift my attitude to a positive one...to a more stoic rather than anxious one...I don't know if I can grow that much. I don't think I have it in me to really take the reins and shift my attitude about it. I'm pathetic in that way. I know exactly what it is I need to do to embrace all of this head on and come out on top. I don't need someone else to tell me how to grow up, or that I need to, or why I need to...I just... can't.",suicide

I've been depressed for probably nearly half my life now. At this point it's hard to imagine being happy. Every day I see my friends living a carefree life, but every single thing I fucking do is ruined by either anxiety or just not being able to get myself off the couch. 

Somewhere during the last schoolyear my anxiety got to the point where I had panic attacks basically every other day, I ended up not going to school for over six months and I told myself it would be better afterwards. Suprise, it isn't. I don't see a future for myself, I don't know how I'm ever going to get anywhere because I'm fucking useless and there's litterally nothing to change about it. The past few weeks I've been thinking about suicide basically every day. Imagining how happy I would be to just let myself fall out of the window. 

It's been this bad before, but back then I always felt more of a barrier holding me back. Right now I have no clue how to go on.

I'm surprised I'm still doing these updates, I honestly thought I would of given up after like one or two posts. This is a new achievement for me. 

First of all I just want to say thank you for all your support and concern, Ive had a lot of messages asking if I seen therapists or psychologists and yes, plenty! Tbh I think it's countless how many professionals Ive seen for my mental health. 

Anyway today was pretty unsuccessful. I didnt go to work, I slept all day and spent all day on my pc playing The Division and lying to everyone I know. I was suppose to see my ex tonight for a movie after work but I told him I was working too late and wasnt feeling up to it. Another guy from work who is obsessed with me also asked if I would see him for coffee and I ignored his message. 
Seeing people makes me so uncomfortable. 

I blocked both of them on my social media, including steam and just played games all day. 

That's it. My day was a typical day for me; ignore everyone and distract myself with games. 
I thought about death only once today and it was about how I'm going to tell my Mum. She hasnt contacted me directly (except through legal letters) in about a month so I'm sure she won't care I'm gone or already thinks i am. Eh, I might leave it alone and not tell her. 
I also need to some how work up the mental strength to go outside and simply get a note pad and pen so I can start writing my goodbye letters to those who I feel needs one. 
It's silly that I have to mentally prepare myself to be in public, I get so anxious and think everyone is staring at me or judging me. I feel so stupid. I can't even get groceries, I usually just get food delivered but it chews through my cash. 
Anyway, I said I wouldn't make this as long as I did yesterday so as always, good vibes to you all. ",suicide

Men want pressure and the vagina to be “tight” so that it will close up and/or push them out. If the vaginal muscles are tight, it means that the woman is tense and/or scared. For men to enjoy intercourse, the woman would need to be scared during.

But for the woman to enjoy intercourse, she’d need to be lubricated, aroused, and experience vaginal tenting (the elongation and widening and loosening of the vagina.)

But that would ruin it for the man because the vagina wouldn’t be closing up and tight and pushing them out anymore.

How do people enjoy life? How do they have sex? How do they get an ounce of pleasure from anything? I want my pain to go away. I want it to be over. 

Is it good for the vagina to close up during Does an extremely narrow vagina feel better to the man? Does it feel like the vagina is squeezing to the man or closing up? 5. Can a vagina be too narrow?

3652,"PainI have lived in pain in one way or another since I was born. Never got to know my father, he was killed in Vietnam when I was 8 months old. Molested by a neighbor for years in my early teens. Battled alcohol and drug addictions through my 20's. Two failed marriages, to many failed careers to count. Diagnosed with prostate cancer 2 years ago. Spent a year having my body ravaged by radiation and chemo plus a couple surgerys. The cancer treatment has left me broken and in constant pain.  Not sure which is worse these days, the mental or physical pain. 

I have tried and tried to live a happy life, but it just never works out. I have unrealistic expectations of what life should be I guess. I am a complete failure as a son, a brother, a father and a husband. I have tried to keep hope for the future alive, but all hope is to me now is torture. 

I was talking with a co-worked last week and it finally hit me, all the things I had given up or put off so I could do what was right by my family will now never be realized. My body is broken and can never be fixed. I lost all hope that day.  I tried to explain it to my wife, she basically said ""so what, your not the only one"". 

I guess she's right, who gives a shit what I want. I am only here to make money to pay bills so that other may live and dream. 

so tired of the pain, so tired of being alone in my head.

3653,"My Story.I've literally just joined Reddit and decided to more or less myfirst post/comment, (from r/survivorsofabuse), here.  I'm using it because I'm not sure whether I have the energy to type something new.  I'll probably add a little more here and there though.

I was groomed when I was 15.  I had just finished my GCSEs (poorly), whilst struggling with a drug addict parent.  This parent would often go missing for 24 hours, act erratically and let me and the other parent down.  Thanks to a rather several severe alterations during the few months prior/during my exams, I lost faith in myself and began struggling to cope.  I was weak, I know.  (My A Levels went more or less the same way).  I began blaming myself for this parents problems, thanks to said alterations.  And so began my fall as a human.

I met Him during our family vacation to Australia.  It lasted throughout my stay and after I left (thanks to the internet).  I knew I was being groomed and I allowed it to happen - I was pretty depressed and felt ugly/alone/unloved - (even though part of me knew I wasn't alone or unloved) - with Him I felt loved/sexy, so I let it him break me down.  Then he just left me.  So I started seeking out other men like Him.  Overtime I began to associate abuse with love/attraction.  The more abusive they were, the more beautiful/the more loved I felt.  

Time passed and I fell even further.  I encountered men who enjoyed treating me like an 'object', a 'faggot', a 'sand nigger', a slave.  I soon found out that these men  were the most abusive.  So I actively started searching for men with that mindset.  Soon I began to believe that I was nothing, just like they all told me.  I found myself subjecting my mind/body to repulsive/humiliating acts, because I wanted to please them.  Because I wanted to be loved.  Because to me abuse was love.  Because the abuse meant I was attractive.  When I hit my 18th birthday I realised I had lost the ability to feel.  I have forgotten what true happiness feels like.  I have virtually no patience, very little empathy and effectively understanding of human emotions.  Thankfully I learnt how to fake it.  I put on a mask in front of everyone.  I'm now that 'bubbly, crazy guy'.  Every so often the mask cracks and my true nature is revealed.  But I'm good at brushing over it;  manipulating people to ignore it;  manipulating them to do what I want.  I also began seducing women - I was desperate to form a REAL connection - to feel REAL love.   

Now I'm nearly 19, and I've been abused by so many men I've lost count.  I've slept with so many women I've lost count.  I now hate children and find myself repulsed by their innocence.  Yet a tiny part of me does want a beautiful wife and even maybe children...one day.  But deep down I know that's never gonna happen.  I know I'm going to die unloved and alone.  

Right now, as I look in the mirror, I don't recognise myself.  I have no hobbies, no interests and usually very few emotions.  Once in a blue moon I do feel - I feel everything all at once.  And then I'll be exhausted and depressed for a while, until the circle restarts.  If I'm honest, today is one of those days.  

I cut myself because I have no control over anything in my life.  I can't control my need to be hurt, which is still there, bubbling under the surface.  Sometimes, I think to myself, 'Find another Alpha to worship;  you deserve to be broken/abused by a real man - it's why you were born'.  

I know I'm pathetic, weak and undeserving.  I know I shouldn't be posting here, because I should be seen and not heard.  I know what I've 'gone through' is nothing compared to what other people endure.  I'm sorry if my post and my weakness angers you.  I'm sorry that what I've been going on about for ages is nothing.  I know I should stay in my lane and shut up but I just can't.   It's like there's a little voice inside of that's screaming to be heard - it wants this all to stop.  I'm exhausted.  I can't keep living like this, even though the other voice, the one begging to be abused, is getting louder.  I feel like there's only one option and that is Death.  I mean isn't Death just the finish line?  The one we've been running to since birth? 

Admitting that doesn't scare/upset me.  What does is that I feel like Death is the only logical/pragmatic solution.  One less stain on the Earth.  One less failure of a son/grandson/brother.  The only way to know and feel true Peace and Purpose.  As I've been whining to all of you, I've begun to realise that this post is meant to be my 'note' to society.  Not that anyone should care.  You all have better things to do that are more deserving of your time.  I'm just being selfish as usual.  Using people for my own sick gain.

I just want the problems to simply just vanish and never appear again, and my problems have made me lose the will to fight any longer.

Simply put, I have Aspergers. I'm 20 years old, and I think I've just about had it with my life. Yes I've had challenges with my Aspergers condition, yes I have done things that I'm not too proud of, but my parents, teachers and peers alike have subjected me to bitter verbal abuse, humiliation and several uncomfortable situations to make me feel unhappy and upset for who I am. My parents felt I was too difficult to deal with and they continued to literally disown me and subject me to harsh treatment.

Even as I joined a fraternity to escape the harsh treatment, my fraternity brothers have continued to do things to screw me over rather than accept the way I am. They took issue with me not opening up as much and forced me into drinking and coming to their parties, and when I asked them for help with a date to our formal, one of my brothers spread a rumor that I wanted to ask her out.

Everybody and everything wants to be against me so better I do die than to move on with my life. Nobody will understand me, nobody will take me seriously, nobody believes my Asperger's so why bother fighting when every resource that I have used has been exhausted?

I don't want to forgive and I don't want my offenders to rest in peace. This is a terrible world after all; all I have is three options: Suicide, Cope Up, or live with it. Maybe suicide is a better option for me since I'm done with everything.

Maybe life isn't worth it anymore, since I don't have anything to live for. I'm too weak to move on, I'm bleeding with the amount of bullet holes riddled in me because of what people have done to me. I even called the suicide hotline 20-25 times because of my problems, and counseling didn't even help at all.

I recover, because I'm mentally strong. But I always return to this dreadful state. The time between being happy and unimaginably sad becomes shorter every time. My mental strength is fading. My bucket of hope is down to its last few drops. 

There is too much going on in my life and I can't take it on alone anymore. That is the problem. I've always been practically on my own. Left to my own self. In my entire 26 years of living I've never met anyone that I could really connect with. And If I did make any friends that I could connect with, the friendship would somehow water down over time. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this post. I'm so confused and plagued by all kinds of thoughts and worry that I can't write a coherent post anymore. Almost everything I try to undertake ends in either mediocrity or failure. I work so damn hard to make something of my life but every time life turns around the corner to kick me in the balls and crush my face into the ground. 

I'm not a real man. In my 26 years of living no woman has ever been interested in me. I can't see why since I'm not ugly or have a bad personality that I know of. Yet apparently nobody wants me. There is just something about me that turns women off. That's the conclusion I'm coming to. Never kissed a woman, been loved by one, never hugged or had deep conversations about life. Never made love. And yes I've date people and such, I'm not the kind of guy you think I am. I don't live under a rock or anything. Not that it would matter. I see all kinds of people ending up in relationships. Only I don't. 

I only have a few friends. One hand is more than enough to count them on. I know quite a lot of people and have a decent social life, but I just always feel like there is a glass wall between me and everyone else. Every time I put myself in a vulnerable position, I get hurt.  

I'm truly tired of life. I truly am. I don't know where to turn to anymore. I don't know what to hope for anymore. Hope for me, has always turned out to be a thing that only enhances my inevitable pain. And I just want the pain to stop.

I've come to despise the happy careless people that act like life is some sort of party and everything is fantastic. They seem to have everything worked out, but didn't have to do very much for it.  People like that have just been dealt good cards and don't know about the true world that surrounds them. Reality is a very cold and heartless place to be in for some people. I've stopped talking about my problems to a certain person from my family I trust a lot. I don't want to bother anyone with my problems anymore. 

I just want to be loved by someone for who I am. That, I've learned, is not a possibility. I don't know how or why, but I seem to be broken and unattractive.

Friends and family would rather cry about what they should have done at your funeral than deal with you while you're alive.  Not that I can bother staying in touch with any of them.  It is exhausting even responding to a text.

There's a constant screaming in my head to end it.  I can't look at my wrists without wanting to slice them wide open, or get a new prescription without looking up how many of the pills it would take to kill me.  Not that I would try either of those, I'd opt for a less painful experience.

3696,"Nietzsche: for the Interested and Depressed   Let me begin by dispelling a common misconception; Nietzsche is not a nihilist. If you associate him with nihilism, dear reader, it may be easier for you to understand what I am about to say if you pretend that you have never heard the name of Friedrich Nietzsche.

   I find that many individuals come to a point where they stop, look around, and realize that they are a mouse in a labyrinth hunting for cheese; however, not only do they seem to be losing the game, but they don't quite see the point of even playing. They find that everything around them is an false image. So much phoniness surrounds them with no escape. Then they look at themselves and find that they have nothing to live for. Congratulations friend, if this is you, you have stumbled upon the dark truth of man. You have made it half the way the way there, but I feel you have one more conclusion to draw that will return purpose to your life! 
	
   Beginning with the arguments of Plato, Socrates, and other Greek philosophers, the original purpose of man was to follow a telos, a goal to seek the purest form of the self. For these thinkers, there was a pure form of justice, of triangles, of logic, and of man that were concealed by images projected by the objects themselves and by culture, and only through argumentation can one find these Forms in a sort of team-effort. This sort of thinking provides, at the very least, a basis for morals and is the foundation for the character we try to instill in children. Remember, even before you started school, how your mothers tried to teach you to be honest and kind as though they were inherent characteristics of man. 
	
   Eventually, people began to question the existence of these Forms such as Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Joseph Conrad, among others. Each of them provided their alternatives to these forms. Likewise, you, seeker of truth, have found that the forms in and of themselves are lies, and it is here you, Nietzsche, Conrad, Holden Caufield, and Hamlet have found common ground; however, it is time to move back from the abyss and find a role and participate in the grand play of this world. 
	
   Nietzsche provides a solution for this issue. Beginning with the given that ALL morality is a fiction, a construct of society, rather than attempting to distinguish truth from fiction, the distinction must be made between fiction and better fiction. Fictions range from an appreciation of Mozart and the Golden Rule to playing hockey or going to the club. But with no grounding for even this quest for fictions, it begs the question, “Why bother with these fictions?” The answer is, “That is life!” A life consists of a collection of actions, of doing, of being, of finding whatever interests you, KNOWING THAT IT IS NOT TRUE. Football, for example, consists men running about attempting to move a pigskin and tackling each other, but millions of people have adopted this fiction and made the rules a part of their lives. Conrad expresses the pursuit of better fictions as turning to “work.” Work is any activity that produces a better understanding of the self and that provides joy. 
	
   While science has discovered that we are a bunch of atoms, you can do nothing with that information! Unless of course, you are a biochemist. 
	
   I haven't expressed all that I would have liked due to homework that I've been putting off, please comment with questions, comments, hate, love, criticism, and I will try to answer accordingly.
   
   TL;DR You may have realized that the truth is we are a bunch of atoms; however, the point of life is not necessarily to find truth but to find more ways to enjoy life and provide substance for it.

I'm the one always fucking up every good thing I've ever had. And then I have to wake up and deal with the piece of shit body. Every morning I'm forced to look at it and I hate it. I can't stand it. But I know I can't change it, even if I were to transition, I would never pass. I'm already 6'3 and have massive fucking limbs and broad shoulders. My facial features are way too masculine and amount of hormones is going to change the fact that I was born a guy. That I'll never be a real woman. That even if I were to transition, I'd have to live a life of fear just because I'm black and trans. I feel like I lose either way, that either way I go, I still end up miserable. I'll never be someones wife or mother, I'll forever be this gigantic freak who wishes they were a woman. I wish that I could be a normal teenage girl for just one day, but I can't and no amount of wishing to an unforgiving god is going to make that happen. I'll forever be mocked and ridiculed, called slurs, and quite possibly assaulted or even murdered. It doesn't help that my grandparents hate trans people, and my parents used to make fun of them.

3714,"My name's Theodore. This is my confession.Let me begin with a disclaimer that I've never used Reddit before and I'm not privy to any existing protocol meant to be followed. English isn't my first language. And mine's a life I wouldn't wish on my worst of enemies.

My name's Theo, and I'm 23 years old. I feel human, though recurring patterns of slightly different, yet monotonously repetitive encounters with some of you make me question that judgment. At times, I feel as lonely and depressed as someone in my position deserves to feel. In others, I dismiss those thoughts as facetious musings of an idle mind. Ever since my childhood years I've felt a gaping disconnect with my peers that's bored a life-sized hole in my sanity; the depths of which would be impossible to define. I took out my rage whenever I could - the only possible way I could - on stray animals which I'd convinced my mother to be allowed into our home. I've harmed many. Wounded more. And killed beyond counting. This, despite never harbouring any intention to hurt;  some of them I'd raised myself. I punched two holes in a baby sparrow's lungs before releasing it, somewhat shocked at what I'd done. It died in mere seconds, squealing as it left behind a bloody mess. I mauled a young pigeon - smashing its round head against my window repeatedly. Mother found its half-eaten carcass returning from work. I also incapacitated my pet rabbit for life once when I was home alone - its only fault being an infectiously bubbly, if slightly excessive enthusiasm. I've lost count of my sickly exploits, but have been blessed enough to have been delivered from those memories and urges in recent times. All this was merely my past - I haven't harmed anything for the past three years. And no one's ever found out.

I've been reasonably aloof throughout the course of my life, my only lens of looking at the world being an unrestrained, unhealthy, and desperate envy. I've hated as much as I've craved with a passion, the maddening happiness that I see in two lovers' eyes. Deep, meaningful, impossibly close relationships. Depraved and manic I may be deemed, but I've always wished, yearned, begged and prayed for that one little ounce of humanity. I've dared only to love once, but was denied. By her fear of me being the monster I seem. My inability to convince her otherwise left me all the more miserable. ""I could be electrifying but possess no morals."" I still glance through her texts on occasion, cherishing her refreshingly youthful, humble innocence. Though I might eventually have killed it. Jk.

None of my other relationships have lasted a year and I'd always preferred it that way. I've always craved something more. Something most people couldn't put a finger on. I've never been bullied or abused, nor have I hurt anyone, but I've always been the distant, unfeeling stranger who observed with a lustful envy - a world he couldn't experience. I'm a monster in a world of men, a monster who wants to love more than any man ever could. Dear Reddit, what do I deserve? ",suicide

However that is not the only reason i'm here,i am used to being lonely,since my childhood really,i don't like it,but i have adapted to it.

A year and a half ago, I left my normal high school, where I had a decent social life with people I had known all of my life, to go to an alternative school so I could graduate early. I graduate at 15 in July. I completed 52 credits at my local community college in two semesters and I am 16 right now. I took all online classes so I do not have any friends in community college. I also wouldn't fit in with them, I'm only 16. 

My parents think I'm inadequate because I hang out with my friends too much but truth is, I only have 2 friends left and I constantly feel like a burden to them because I always want to hang out with them since they are all I have. My 2 friends think I am inadequate because I am shallow, they have been ignoring me ever since I told them I got into my dream university.

I am not an interesting person because I don't actually have a personality, I surround myself with all these achievements because I am nothing without them. I am so alone. I alienated my friends, they are sick of me because all I am is just a resume.

What if I don't deserve real friends because I'm so shallow? What if I never have a good personality and am just a long list of achievements?

My stress and anxiety levels have been cranked up to the max for so long, I don't remember what happy feels like. My family betrayed me and abandoned me, haven't even bothered to contact me in over a year.

I bought a house with my husband, I thought having something to focus on would make me better. It was a terrible idea, the house is so fucked. I think I'm going to go bankrupt trying to fix it. My husband moved to the other side of the world for a new job, and I'm meant to go over too so I have two weeks to try and finish it, find a renter and get ready to move to a different country and I just don't see it happening. Ive already injured myself trying to do all the work that needs a team by myself.

Basically I feel like I should just give up now. I keep trying and I either fuck it up or get screwed over and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of putting on a happy face, I'm sick of being positive for other people and I'm sick of being in pain all the time.

I contemplate suicide every day, usually as soon as I wake up... as if it was already on my mind while I slept. How come I get up and drag myself out the house every day to work, then school... ?

Because I know to be saved I have to save myself... nobody is going to do it for me. Nobody is going to think I'm worth anything unless I become worth something, nobody is going to love me until they can't live without me. 

So that's what it is... my own personal rebellion. I'm gonna prove  those people who used me and mock me and don't care weather I live or die that they're wrong... killing myself would only prove them right. So instead I'm going to show them I am a smart, strong, determined person who the world can't tear down. I'll fight, I won't lay down and die like they want me to. I'm going to become something just to spite them, to prove them wrong... maybe secretly tho... I'm gonna do it just for myself, because I know I'm worth it.

3728,"I feel helpless watching myself destroy my futureHi SW. I'm a student at university, I should be happy with where I am and the subject I'm studying but I'm not. I've been having problems with education and my social life as far as I can remember. It is only now that these problems have intensified to the extent where my life has become a disorganized mess. I have been to several councilors in high school to help keep myself up to date with homework and coursework. Since I've started university I have fallen behind on my work and social life. My dorm room was covered with post-it notes and reminders on my walls, I was forgetting to complete and hand in coursework. I've been receiving letters from my tutors who are concerned about my progress. At the end of last term it was too much and I had a breakdown.

I went to see my doctor about the problems i've been having, he was not much help so he is referring me to a psychiatrist. I'm now on a six month waiting list. I have not discussed any of my problems with my parents as I'm afraid of disappointing them. They will be furious at me for destroying an opportunity to a good career and life. I feel like this is beyond my control now. I've wasted a lot on my cost of living and tuition fees. I lost a lot of friends I have made by being selfish and neglecting them. I feel the only way forward is to end my own life. By the time I get to see a psychiatrist it will be too late, and even if i do get 'help' sooner I doubt it will change much about myself. 

This is my third time re-writing this, so i hope I got my message across clearly. I'm sorry for not being more specific about everything. If I try explain things I start rambling and don't get a point across. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",suicide
3730,"My professor is a hypocrite. I'm still in highschool taking dual credit, but I already hate the idea of college professors, especially if they are as problematic as mine.

My teacher pretends to be super liberal, but is an older man and says extremely sexist and racist things that genuinely hurt certain students in the class.  But this isn't even my problem.

My professor just thinks he has so much power over everything, he acts like he is this high and mighty ruler and if we break the most minute rule we literally will not pass the class.

I attend my zoom meetings online every single day, and I never miss a class, but one day I forgot to do the sign in sheet, my teacher refused to count me present despite the fact that I interact with the teacher more than almost any other student. 

My professor constantly mentions plagiarism and how it's wrong (which I do agree with,) but literally every quiz he makes is plagiarized from some quizlet he finds online, I'm fine with it because it makes studying and cheating on the quizzes the easiest thing ever, but that's pretty hypocritical.

I just really hope that not all professors are like this, especially when I can see that he's definitely not even close to the most problematic one.",non-suicide

3733,"Just hurt to much and I'm so tired.It's been 9 months since my wife of 15 years left. She started immediately (was most likely cheating) dating a friend of mine. They broke up a few months later. Now she's getting married to a different person, he is a great guy. My kids love him, as she likes to brag to me about. All our old friends, my own kids, even her family that I loved and was closer to me than my own, they all are thrilled about this engagement. 

I drank heavily when she left. For months. Ended up so depressed and drunk all the time that I went  to the ER because I wanted to kill myself. I spent 37 days in a facility doing counseling for my depression.

I got out and was feeling good again. Got a new job, got my own apartment (was forced to move back home with parents as I couldn't afford lawyer and rent etc.etc).. I thought I was turning the corner and my life was going to be ok. 

And then boom, it hits me all again. Like she just left yesterday. I'm so sad again. 

I've dated a few women recently, they all suck compared to her. I can't stand any woman for more than sex and a brief conversation. Honestly I can't stand when one of them texts me.

I'm recently married to a wonderful lady. I have fantastic parents. No debt. Good health. I am in good standing in my program, and I have a job offer for when I graduate. So why am I getting these thoughts? Is it the 80-hour workweek with no sign of reprieve? Am I imaging all the other students hating me? Why don't my advisers ever seem satisfied with my work? Why do they treat me and my time like it is worthless? I always feel rushed and, consequently, incapable and irresponsible. Is this real or just an unreasonable environment? Is this all be compounded by being many, many thousands miles away from home?

No one knows it, but I am struggling. They all think I am making leaps and bounds in my work. I am. But I am falling fast. The only reason I haven't off'd myself is because of what how my family would take it. It would not be not fair to them. I owe them more than that, but if they were to disappear, so would I.

I tell myself this is only for a limited duration, that it will all be OK once I graduate, but could I be dealing myself some kind of long-term mental harm by being in a program that is so bad that I consider ending my life just to escape it?

I want to go home, but if I do that now, I'll be seen a failure.

I'm in no danger tonight, but I operate one day at a time.

3735,"This just in: Four new Undertale AUs now in progress simultaneously! I started VGamer1991 Studios about four or five years ago when I was attempting to use GameMaker 8.1 (yes, the Windows 8.1 version of the same program initially used to create Undertale) to take a crack at writing my first original video game. The project quickly folded, however, when I realized a completely original project was too much for me to take on with no experience in programming, despite the fact that GameMaker is marketed as being easy to use even with absolutely zero experience. The game was gone and all public mention of my studio was quickly wiped off the radar but I kept the dream and the related goals alive in my heart. I may or may not revive the original project as there are people out there who would be interested in playing it but it was never meant to be a sort of game that anyone outside of a particular group would get into. Undertale is for everyone and I have hacked games in the past, so I think I’m much better off starting at a point that is obviously closer to my comfort zone.

Here, however, come not one, nor two, nor three, but FOUR new Undertale AUs. One, which I am calling Frisk’s New Home, was an idea I got fairly early on when I realized I was not quite happy with vanilla Undertale. Another, Getting Revenge Together, is a customized version of Undertale Together that has ties with another AU I’m making. The third, Diana’s New Home, is a further customized version of Frisk’s New Home in which the character looks more like me, but this AU could also be seen as the prequel to my final AU, Don’t Let This Happen, which tells the story of Diana (the title character of the previous AU), who ran away from the human world entirely after she came out of an abusive relationship with Derek, the ~~~protagonist~~~ antagonistic player character in this AU. Don’t Let This Happen forms the basis for the previous two while Frisk’s New Home was something I thought up separately.

After deciding to make Frisk’s New Home I always knew I wanted to redo Undertale Together but my mind hadn’t yet fully formed the idea of Don’t Let This Happen. Once that idea did form, however, it was only natural that Diana’s New Home was the topping of choice with which to ice the cake, after the final piece of the puzzle that has become Getting Revenge Together was in place.

I will reveal that the title of Don’t Let This Happen comes from the fact that Derek finds that Diana has committed suicide after being relentlessly tormented by the memories of what Derek put her through when they were a couple living on the Surface (similar to how it seems likely Chara also committed suicide canonically), and it is also a warning to me, the AU’s creator, to not let my fellow humans down by committing suicide (since I have honestly struggled with depression and suicidal ideation since I was eight years old and it has only gotten worse over the years, as within the past decade I was with someone who wasn’t good for me and they put me through things that I then based the early storyline on).

Getting Revenge Together is based off of a sort of True Pacifist run of Don’t Let This Happen, where Diana and her new lover, Aidan, come back to the Underground after Derek goes there to live in exile when he gets tired of life in the village where he had already been living in exile on the Surface.

Growing up, I had a pretty decent childhood. Both parents were present, in a way. My dad was always working to provide for us. So whenever I'd have to talk to my dad, it was usually for punishment. 

My parents provided a lot of things for my sisters and me, such as a house, food, clothes, etc. However, they were never there for us emotionally. I don't ever remember being asked how I was feeling or how my day went. I never really had anyone to talk to, so all of these emotions were suppressed.

Fast forward years later, and both of my parents have ran out of patience. I'm my dad's least favorite. He always claims that he loves all of us equally, but that's not true. There was a saying that stuck to me, ""The axe forgets, but the tree remembers.""

I'll never forget some of the things that my dad has done. Where he prefers my sisters over me.

Fast forward a few years later, my two younger sisters are always against me. My dad always chooses their side, and I'm just so tired. I get yelled at for defending myself. There's so much going on right now. I'd rather end it all now.

3750,"I'm just so tired of it allI have been struggling with chronic pain for 25 years since I was 14. I worked so hard at everything then and had a lot of good teachers and coaches that helped me to be excel. I lived in a small town and was from a small town where everybody knew me and my family and I always had a lot of pressure to be great at whatever I did and my best was never good enough. If I got a single B on my report card my parents would focus and that and why it wasn't perfect while other siblings that never even tried got rewarded if they didn't fail any classes. I was always doing more than my peers because I wanted to live up to the expectations others had for me. My 8th grade year I went undefeated in wrestling because I had a great coach who was happy with however I did. He was just as happy for everyone on the team when they gave their best no matter if they only won a single match all year and I thought that was great. He was the best and came from a foster home and just wanted to help kids have fun and treated everyone like they mattered and that's why I was so successful under him. The summer after that season my dad signed me up for several wrestling camps and after I asked him not to. I was a perfectionist and had been to several of these camps before and they push children to their breaking point and my parents could never understand that. So I went and did 3 wrestling camps that summer as I recall that were ran by middle aged guys that had gone to the Olympics and they were brutal and I would work out contantly  even when not in the camps because that is the kind of person I was. During camp I injured my neck and shoulder severely and laid on the mat thinking I was paralyzed from it and it took a lot of effort to even wiggle my fingers. Nobody even came over to check on me and eventually I stood up but my head just wobbled around like an infant learning to use its muscles. I managed to work up the strength to get through the camp and not miss any of it by just flexing every muscle I could to support my neck. When I went home and told my parents instead of taking me to the hospital they just had an argument about it. I had disclocated some ribs too and could see them protruding from my sternum. I continued wrestling while in school but was never the same after that. I took one year off after my sister died in a traffic accident because I didn't care anymore. The high school coach pulled me out of spanish class when I didn't show up for the first practice lecture me on how I was being a quitter and I would regret it. I just ignored him and went home and cried as I did often. That year off my dad finally took me to the family doc who just said it was a pulled muscle and to get physical therapy. I did everything that was asked of me and more and it didn't help. Then came chiropratic care which thankfully enabled me to turn my head again but the burning stabbing pain and the headaches from it were still constant. I just told myself that once I graduate from college and got out of this small town I'd find a doc with a brain that could help. I'd never had an MRI or even an x-ray and it was frustrating. Eventually I graduated and got a job and got married to a very kind person who was determined to help me. I've been to so many family docs, massage therapists accupuncture, surgeons, pain management docs and I can't even remember what else. After my first surgery a decade ago I had to quit my job because I couldn't even raise my dominant arm. When I was working before the surgery I would have to lay on the floor of my office for a couple hours a day to try to relieve the pain. I eventually was diagnosed with a severe labral tear, herniated discs throughout my entire cervical spine, arthritis in my neck, and radiculopathy that causes numbness in my arm. I have been living a spoonie life for a long time. If I don't do much during the day I can keep my pain at manageable levels but if I do anything that involves turning my head or using my dominant shoulder the pain quickly becomes unmanageable. When the pain is at a 9 or 10 I become suicidal and just want it to stop and to avoid the feelings I avoid doing much of anything to keep my pain down. Just carrying in groceries or doing computer work (my previous occupation) for an hour gets my pain out of whack.  I applied for disability insurance a few months ago and was denied. The independent company that made the determination sent me a letter saying to call if I had any questions or other info to supply and I called two or three times on different days and they wouldn't even answer the phone or return my call. They then proceeded to deny my application saying I wasn't disabled 5 years ago when I have been dealing with this for 25 years and had over a 100 pages of doctor notes covering the last 10 years of my medical history. I am so depressed right now as a result and am just tired of fighting this and don't see the point of living. I always wanted children but didn't have any because I didn't feel I could adequately take care of them since I can barely take care of myself. My wife wants me to get a lawyer and fight it but I am just so tired. I contacted one last night via chat then called them today and they didn't answer. I have called the suicide hotline a few time previously and am discouraged my the automated system that answers and hang up after waiting a couple minutes. Nobody seems to understand what I deal with on a daily basis except my wife who has watched me struggle with it every damn day, waking several times a night from severe pain over the past 15 years. I am lucky to have a loving wife that works hard to support us but I feel so guilty and useless and my pain wears on her too and isn't fair to her. She shouldn't have to put up with somebody like me. I love her so much but sometimes she gets overwhelmed and wants to leave for good and I understand. I am so depressed and have cut myself with razors just to see what it feels like. The pain from cutting is like nothing compared to the pain I feel constantly and is actually a nice distraction from my usual pain. I have considered swallowing all of my prescription meds but don't want to hurt the docs that prescribed them to me by doing that and don't want to hurt other patients who depend on these meds wither. I have also choked myself with my belt a few times and have been so close to killing myself over the years but don't want to cause my wife any more pain than I already have, she doesn't deserve that. If it wasn't for her I would probably be dead by now but that is an awful lot of pressure to put on her. I don't think I am going to kill myself now but am just having another hard time with a lot of suicidal thoughts and don't feel like I can take much more of this at the moment. We recently had to move across the country to a suburb of a major city and I hate it. It is so noisy all the time and I can't get any peace and quiet anywhere. I used to be able to drive a couple minutes to the river where I would just sit and meditate for hours multiple times a week but now I don't feel like I have any way to decompress. I have a service dog I trained myself that is with me all the time and that helps but she isn't happy in the city either. I hope we can move again soon but that upsets my wife. She likes her new job and took it despite my objections. I am trying so hard to get by and support her in her new job but I don't see her much anymore since she works 11 hours a day 5 days a week now on many weeks meaning I only see her around 2 hours a day when she gets home. We have planned vacations but they have been cut short due to her work projects and I fear that other scheduled vacations will face the same. Sorry to complain so much. I should be more grateful for what I have and know a lot of people have it worse off but it is hard sometimes. I am just so tired of living with sever pain 24 hours a day and feel like society doesn't want me in it. The gov is always trying to take away my medicine and I am always being judged by people for not working and being told by social security now that I am not disabled even after all the documentation I have makes me feel like nobody will ever understand what I go through. I don't need any responses, just wanted to type this all out and vent for a minute. If you have to choose between responding to me or someone else who has posted here please choose them over me and I'll understand.

3757,"So guess who just got a breakup Well, just is an understatement. It's been 1 month and 4 days, but, who's counting? He dumped me through text. He was talking to my online fried about me and was asked if he still liked me. So he said, and this is a direct quote, ""used to, but now I'm bi, so I have a different group of people to like."" Five seconds later, a screenshot of their conversation was sent to me by him. I played dumb at first, thinking he meant me to see the ""I'm bi"" part rather than the ""used to like her"" portion. I guess I thought he was too good to tell me he was over me so cruelly. In the end, I gave in and saw what I was meant to see. But by then, my natural reflexes to hide my emotions had kicked in, and I pretended that I didn't give a damn. But I did. And I still do.

To be honest, I can't quite work out how I feel about this. My emotions range from ""we're mature 13-year-old so we can get through this and become stronger together"", to ""I know it's weird to be around him, but you can still be civilised"", to ""go die you fucking bastard who's far too chicken to be worth my time"". Around him, I put on a fake front, smile, laugh, act like I don't care, but inside it hurts to see him happier without me. I guess the fact of life is that I miss him.

I miss his quirky, geeky personality and his obsession with all things medical. I miss how he was tried to fit into the crowd and yet managed to be so entirely unique and special. I miss the way he would do anything to cheer me up, miss his ability to make me laugh in a split second, miss how he would make me feel like the only person in the world who mattered. I miss our long talks, the way I was the first person he approached when faced with any problem and vice-versa. Most of all, I miss the trust we had in each other. He was my best friend. And now barely a proper sentence passes between us each day.

It's been more than a month since I got dumped and I know I'm over him. Yet, I still feel hollow inside, like part of me is missing. My friends tell me he's not worth it, that he's trash and I should move on. But I still defend him because we're friends, right?

I don't know if feeling this way is normal, and I don't know if what I did in terms of hiding my emotions was right. All I know is I want my best friend back, but I want him to be happy. I don't need him to like me or love me, just please, treat me as a friend.

3777,"trapped to live.I go to a big, huge, expensive, and famous school. It's known as one of the biggest party schools in the country. I was so excited to attend when I first decided to enroll here. I thought I was going to turn into the awesome, independent, alive person that I always imagined myself to be. 

Now I'm sitting in my trashed room, bored to tears. I'm so sick of these four walls. I'm so sick of smoking weed and Netflix, (something I never thought I would say). I'm sick of taking walks down the same streets, seeing all the people with their friends and significant others and families. While I'm alone. 

During the last school year I think I might have isolated myself a bit unintentionally. I went through some really hard things, and because I didn't have the energy to go out and party a lot, I stayed home and drew in my room. I drew beautiful pictures of people and fairies and these crazy designs that I was so proud of. 

But after awhile, people stopped inviting me to parties and such, they knew i was going to decline. I don't blame them.
But now it's summer and all my friends that I would at least have interaction with are gone. I have those little suicidal thoughts all the time, but they don't scare me anymore. I guess they don't scare me anymore because I've realized that no matter what I can't kill myself. Because I decided to go to college, I've racked up an enormous amount of debt. My step dad cosigned the loans, so if I croaked, all my precious debt would go to him. I couldn't do that to my parents, they've done too much to help me, they're too good of people to deserve that burden. 

If I would have been a responsible and hard working student, I would have graduated this past May. But instead I'm kinda no where near. I don't like to think about it, but I have so much stress about financial aide and all that stuff.. its terrifying. Especially because I'm spending an incredibly barbaric amount to (maybe) get a degree that (might) get me an okay job worth a bachelors degree in the human services field. It's like I'm kidding myself if I think it's worth it. But I have no choice but to go through with it, because it's my only chance to be successful. I absolutely love my major, it's like it was made for me, but I know it's not going to be enough to conquer my debt.

It's not fair. I feel like I was forced into making huge decisions when I was younger that would decide my whole future, and I'm slowly realizing now that I made all the wrong ones. And because of my bad choosing, I'm now stuck. I can't kill myself. I can't just run away and start a new life. I have to go through this painful, slow process of failing. ",suicide

3792,"Dammit...thought I was getting better!!!Sigh. I thought when I was being discharged from the hospital last Wednesday that I could go home and everything would be better. I got home and it was back to the same bullshit that I had tried to kill myself over. The ""funny"" thing is that there isn't anything SPECIFIC that is happening that I can put my finger on and say ""this is why I feel this way!"" Things with my hubby and kids are okay and life has just gone back to the same routines, the same things every day. They aren't bad things. They aren't things that trigger my depression feelings. 

So why the fuck am I still feeling this way? WHY AM I STILL HERE? Gah. Sorry guys. I have no clue what is going on. My depression (even with this new medication) has deepened once again. I am not at the point of suicide though. The medication sort of helps me block out those feelings effectively so I don't try to hang myself or slit my wrists open. I don't WANT to go back to the hospital because that would effectively destroy a marriage that is already shaky because of my last attempt. That would send it over the edge and I don't want to go there. I really don't feel the urge to kill myself anyhow (a good thing!) but I can't help thinking that I really wish I HAD died when I overdosed. I wish I had been successful. :(

Good grief. I am pissed off because I can't cut anymore. That would also destroy things. If my hubby or kids saw cuts again (especially this soon after getting out of the hospital) he would leave me in a heartbeat. 

So...what am I left with? Frustration. Sadness. Deep deep depression. Anxiety. 

I can't eat...and I won't eat now. I had gained 5 lbs. in the hospital and now...I am losing all of that and some. I am hungry all the time and I don't give a shit. I like the pain of the hunger anyhow. It is comforting to me. I wish I could lose faster and be 100 lbs. already.

I need to go now. I have rambled on quite enough and I am having a hard time focusing on the screen again.

Sorry to whine here, but I have nowhere else to turn. 

I thought I was done with SuicideWatch...but I guess not...

If I need to go, just tell me. I am not suicidal per say...just...lost?

My life is static due to an early life crisis. See I had always known I wanted to be a writer since childhood. It was all I ever saw myself doing. When I was in the 12th grade I entered in an essay contest and I overheard the head of the contest talking about my essay. His words were "" this is why he will never be a good writer"" as he said it we made eye contact. I was lost for words and in the moment pretended I didn't hear anything. The next day I was more depressed than I had ever been. I lost faith in my skill and my dream. I couldn't even muster the strength to go to school. 3 years later I'm a drop out with no idea what I want to do with my life and I'm angry at everyone and everything. I try to write and I'm not happy with anything I come up with. Everyone in my life thinks I graduated and am working on getting into community college classes and that I want to be a filmmaker. I have tried to make short films but they are all shit and unwatchable. The truth is that I walk around pretending to be homeless and sleep on park benchs.  I tried to off myself because I truly think I'm going to spend the rest of my life like this, but at the moment of truth I realised I didn't really want to die. The problem now is that I don't know what to do. I can't go back to school, I can't write with confidence, and my films are trash. Its also too late to tell my friends the truth without losing them.

its stupid that i'm even here. i can't kill myself. i can't do that to my parents. i've been such a fuck up of a daughter that it seems the least i can do is not kill myself while they're still around. my boyfriend had one fiancee die, it would be cruel for me to die on him too. those thoughts usually keep me strong against it but some nights they're just pathetic words.

3805,"Bored and apathetic. I really don't know where to start here. I'm 17 years old (18 in 2 weeks) and just moved in to college. I've been really depressed for many years. I've never been very social, never had anyone I was really close to for very long. My parents are divorced, I'm not very close to either of them. Mom and I always fight, Dad cheated on her and beat me and my brother (only a few times tho). I'm also gay. 

 I've never had any vision of what I wanted my life to be outside of high school, and I still don't. I don't care about studying or what my major is. To me, life is inherently pointless. You're born, you live, you die. Whatever career you pick doesn't matter, and whatever joy you derive from those you surround yourself with is fleeting. It's like I want to meet and interact with other people but I realize whenever I try that it really doesn't matter. I have nothing of interest to say and I don't really care what anyone else has to say. 

I've just been so bored and apathetic for a long time. I can remember lying in bed when I was like 8 thinking how much better my parent's lives would be if I had never existed. 

I've been thinking of suicide for a long time, but have never gathered the courage to go through with anything because knowing me, I'd probably fuck up any suicide attempt I'd ever make. I know everyone here is just gonna give me the usual ""you have so much to live for,"" ""it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" shit. I've heard all that before and it doesn't mean anything to me. I don't value money, success, material goods, or companionship so the rewards of this world mean nothing to me, and the whole appeal of suicide is its permanence. Saying that killing yourself is something that can't be undone is like telling a sex addict that girls have tits. Kind of counterproductive to what you were going for, I think.

I know self-diagnosis isn't reliable and has a bad reputation, but I've been through so much trauma (growing up and currently living in a severely abusive household, being raped and molested as a kid, being bullied for years, struggling to accept my homosexuality, etc). I've had suicidal thoughts as long as I can remember. I haven't been truly happy in years because I always feel numb and apathetic, and when I do have emotions, I'm drowning in sadness. Even doing small tasks like showering or dressing myself are exhausting and difficult to do.   

I've never been officially diagnosed for depression, and even if I were, there's no possible way for me to be treated for it. My parents don't believe in mental health or mental illnesses and think that therapy and medication is a sham. The other potential sources of help in my life aren't great either. Multiple times in the past, I've tried to tell my doctor that I'm suffering from depression, and she told me that she didn't really think I was. My school's counselor isn't helpful because she doesn't listen to me and would keep telling me that I just needed to be less stressed.   

I have constant breakdowns where I want to harm myself. Most of the time when I have them, they happen for no reason. My most recent one was on Saturday, February 10th. My mother got angry with me and tried to stab me, but I ran away and locked myself in my room. I started crying while laying down on the floor and the breakdown started. I felt like I was having a heart attack and that my systems were shutting down. I could feel myself screaming and convulsing but I couldn't stop. I kept thinking of slitting my wrists (I've never done that form of self-harm though, I'm scared of what would happen if my parents noticed) during it and was so afraid of what my hands might do to myself, and I felt like I didn't have any control over them. At some point, I started slamming my head against the floor and wall because I was in complete agony and I knew it was all in my head and I wanted to make it stop. Usually I have a breakdown approx. once every three months, but I've had three already since 2018 started.

I'm afraid I'm going to kill myself if my depression doesn't get treated soon. I can't wait 2 more years to leave home and get treated then, I don't think it's possible.

He convinced my mom to homeschool me,which she only did once a week until sixth grade. After that nothing. I never had any interactions with anyone else other than them my whole childhood.

When I turned twenty I miraculously passed the GED test and got a drivers license and was kicked out of the house by my stepdad. I was homeless and got a minimum wage jobs and roommates that never worked out, because I had no social skills and still don't.

But I am ending my life. I can't take anymore. I have survived being raped and molested from age 5 to 8 by my step dad. *I am a guy.* I suffered from him beating me daily till I was bleeding. I have suffered from him torturing me and tying me to a tree for days on end no food or water, my mom not caring. him trying to kill me. I have suffered ten years homelessness. never going to school, not learning to read or write until I was 20. now I am 38. I have spent ten years homeless on the streets and have seen many deaths either natural or murders or suicides live right in front of me. I have been shot at, stabbed, had a guy shoot a gun next to my ear while robbing me and causing permanent hearing loss in my left ear. 

I suffer from morbid obesity and can't lose weight from my hormones being out of whack and from genetics being messed up. I have been obese since childhood. no matter what I did, it didn't help or work. 

I have never had family, friends, no one has ever loved or wanted me, even down to my own family. I had to raise myself since I was 5 years old. Had no childhood, never went to school etc. Lost my mom when I was 25, she passed, never knew my real dad till I was 23 then he died a few months later. no siblings no aunts or cousins. I am utterly alone in this world. 

To this day I suffer from PTSD, Severe Social Anxiety, Severe Chronic Depression, OCD, ADHD, Dyslexia, Suicidal Tendencies, I have a very addictive personality, I suffer from Regular Anxiety, Paranoia, Severe Abandonment Issues. And no meds or therapy helps. I have tried for ten years to get it all fixed.

Past eight years I have spent in the dating scene and trying to find a woman to date and settle down with. Past 8 years I have been rejected around 1600 times and told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer a woman or give a woman, mocked at laughed at, told I don't deserve love or a relationship, told I needed to end my life for being so fat and lazy.
 

The other night I had this woman tell me she was interested in talking to me, she loved what she read about me and thought I sounded like a wonderful man. Told me she was fighting alcoholism, was 37, a single mom of 4. living with her parents and jobless. but then she seen my pics and then she said I should be ashamed of myself and I am worse than a drug addict and there is no way she would be with someone as ugly and fat as I am.

Past eight years I have put myself out there and haven't had one date let alone one woman give me a chance. maybe she is right.

Since I was 20 all I wanted to do was find someone who I can eventually settle down with. Be romantic with. who enjoys gaming either it be card games, board games, video games, or just binge watch movies or tv shows. who enjoys the flea markets, parks, lakes, long road trips to nowhere. enjoys slow dancing and snuggling. Someone who is serious and wants to eventually live together and be a real couple. Someone to grow old with and to have a long lasting relationship with.

I would love to find someone to wake up in the morning her in my arms, me sneak out of bed, make breakfast for her. Someone to go to the park, lake or just sit around the house play card/board games or do arts and crafts with and if she had kids we do that stuff as a family. 

To be a family that sits at the dinner eat dinner together. if she has kids then we have family nights every weekend and every other weekend would have family talk night where her kids and her and I could talk and say anything openly without worry or fear of being judged by each other so the kids could have that support at home they would need. 

I would love to have someone to be romantic with and have  nights under the night sky with champagne, candles, roses, and her in my arms. I would love to find someone to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and holidays together. To have that companionship, closeness, togetherness with someone. To be able to just be next to that person and they just look at you and are smiling just because you are right there next to them and you are the reason they are smiling and the reason their eyes are twinkling. 

I get told I am a great guy, an amazing guy, a wonderful man, told any woman would be lucky to have me, then when they find out I am overweight they reject me, ghost me, mock me, bully me, say cruel mean hateful things. maybe they are right though. maybe my weight does make me all those things. and because I can't lose the weight and I can't have the surgery. I will just end it and save this world from having to suffer another day with me in it.

3871,"I don't know what's the point of posting here, but I'll just say everythingThere are too fucking many different problems in this life. First of all, I live in Russia, which is like top 2 suicidal country. I'm 19, I've never had a real friend, never in my entire life. I'm starting to feel like best friends are an illusion, all the people I was friends with were so superficial. I broke up with the only friends I had a year ago. I still think about them, about our memories and the things I've said. And the point is I don't even think that what I said wasn't true, I just shouldn't have said it. 
I felt lonely in their company, which is the worst feeling ever. 

And I've never felt live or lived anyone truly in my entire life either. I have normal parents, but they've always worked a lot. I don't feel their love and I don't really love them back. 

All this led to me finding a way of drawing attention to myself. And the easiest I could find is becoming a femboy, wearing girly clothes for men to fuck me. And even though It does turn me on, when I'm not horny I know that that's not who I am. That's now what I need. 

And among my acquaintances there are no people that I'd like to be my best friend or girlfriend. I just keep rejecting people myself. I can't do anything about it. 

Moreover, I don't have real passion for anything. I have tried many things. I like them, but I realize that I make myself do them. Make myself watch a movie, make myself read a book, make myself play piano. I don't feel anything, I don't want anything, but love, someone to hug, someone, who genuinely would care about me and someone who I WOULD ALSO care about.

Plus there are fucking health problems, like fucked up mind is not enough. I'm 19 and I've had hemorrhoids 3 times, I have a problem with my facial skin, my knees hurt, there are some fucking things in my throat, and I'm gaining fat. 

I know that doing sports is supposed to make your body and mind be healthier, but I just don't see a point. I can't be happy by just running around, I DON'T LOVE ANYTHING OR ANYONE. 

And where do I meet people? Like just go hit on a random girl that might not have a personality I'll like, or that won't like my personality, or even won't find me attractive in the first place. I've said I have skin problem that I can't cure for 6 or more years.

I really don't care. I wish I could believe in god, that would help. But I just don't. So I don't care if I die. Literally the only thing that stops me is my mom. I don't want her to grief. I don't even care about my dad, or brother, or anyone else. I know that I'm going to kill myself eventually. Whether in a year, or when I'll be 90 years old. But I want to do it now. 

Everything is fucking disappointing, EVERYTHING.",suicide

3886,"My own life has been seeing great progress, but the world ending keeps making me miserable. It's time for me to end.After years of thinking my drawings sucked and I'll never be able to make a living off of them, I've got work at an indie game developer and am seeing commissions for drawings and animations.  After years of browsing Forever Alone, hitting 30 as a virgin, and not having a girlfriend for a decade, I've seen two girls physically attracted to me this year, have chatted for months with a fellow geek on a dating app, and have our first date tomorrow.  After thinking I can't support myself as an independent adult, I've got my own 1-room apartment and am working 2 jobs to successfully live for myself.

After decades of struggling and self-hatred, my life is finally getting better.  But guess what?  Ultimately, it doesn't matter.

My state of mind regarding humanity and life started to break when 9/11 happened in my first month of high school.  I had my eyes truly opened to how violent, hateful, unjust, and painful humanity really was both in the majority of civilization and seemingly at its core.  It took years of therapy to suppress these feelings (My core philosophy/belief of humanity and us all better off dead remained but I stopped dwelling on it), but after the Feguson riots and first rash of recorded racist cop killers hit, something in me snapped again and has consumed me daily from then on.

It doesn't stop.  It doesn't leave me.  If it's not racism it's some other form of suppression.  If it's not Trump it's some other public figure ruining everything forever.  If it's not global warming it's dystopian facism inevitably winning over us all.  I can't escape into media like I used to because they're all becoming increasingly topical.  Every day, either something in the world reminds me of things, or I remind myself when my mind wanders because it's instinctive at this point.  I cry, become numb and immobile, and can barely talk or function for hours at a time while pure despair, fear, sadness, and hopelessness overtake me.  Every day.

I can't sleep because of these.  I can't work as much as I want because of them.  I'm in therapy minimum twice every week and have seen a half-dozen different therapists in the past two years alone.  I've tried dozens of meds and been hospitalized both voluntarily and involuntarily five times.  Nothing works.

I have a large, loving group of family and friends, but they're unable to snap me out of it.  I can no longer value them or my own successes.  I've long hit that realization that myself and them and our lives and dreams are permanently irrelevant now.  The world is perpetually burning into either a miserable existence for almost all or the full-on extinction I so desire.  From now on, nothing we do has any value or importance.  I have nothing to strive for and nothing I can enjoy.

I'm going to let my family and friends enjoy one more Christmas season with me, but come January, I'm going to finally carry out one of my suicide plans I've mapped for years.  I thankfully live in an area where my main two ideas are super easy to pull off and no one can stop me if I don't say my goodbyes until right before I take action.  The letter is written, and I can cross post it to all my social media accounts before finding peace through ceasing to exist.  As an atheist, I believe my consciousness will disappear from all planes of existence, and as long as it means I can never suffer again, it's a sacrifice I don't just accept, but get excited for. Humanity still abides to survival of the fittest just like our original existence in nature.  For all my qualities, the world has made my ability to live non-existent.  It's better that I erase myself.",suicide

3890,"I don't know where else to turnThe past year has been the start of just a fucking shit show to come and I've lost the will and compassion to feel or do much if not anything- I'm only here because I've no idea where else to go. 

Mid 2018 early 2019, me and the girl I was extremely close with loosing touch with one another. We both had feelings but both too anxious to say or do anything about it. After that she got with someone else she barely knew and with little reason, I supported it because I care about her and wanted to support her every decision but it had such a fucking horrible negative backlash on me I spent all my time in year 10/11 locked in a cubicle doing really unhealthy shit. This continues till we leave secondary school and we joined college. She only talks to me when she's drunk or there's no one else to talk to and it fills me with such regret and self hatred I cannot contain it. I still loose sleep over it.
 
Mid 2019 - present day, so much has happened I struggle to compute what's going on anymore. I'm forced to move out of my dads because his mental health condition affects my own, leading to several attempted suicide accounts and more successive frequent relapses of self harm (continuing up until this day). I get very very very close with a guy I love really fucking dearly and he was the only person that would speak to me, he has a boyfriend, we ended up sleeping together a few times (he's allowed it's an open relationship thing I don't know) and I feel completely and utterly belittled by the bf. I don't talk to him but I know that no matter anything I do I'll never be as much to him as his partner or anything else. The guys friends approach me and tell him he's turning into me which changed how I look at absolutely everything with him, he started listening to everything I listen to, he stated self harming again because I did. He became me and it's no one's fault but my own. I wish he never met me, whatever happened it wasn't worth it. We don't talk anymore.

My dad tried to kill himself on Christmas eve. I was waiting at his house for him to come home and he turns up late telling me how he was really low and how he tried to kill himself because of an argument with a friend. He went to an overpass near a Trainline, a bridgelike thing leading onto a very busy road below. He only stopped because a homeless man talked him out of it. It made me cry but I couldn't tell him it upset me because I've never been taught how to show compassion and it made me feel terrible.

Christmas was similar. Insomnia allowed me to sleep at ≈6am woke up to 4 children screaming at 7:30am to open their presents. I didn't get anything but I didn't and still don't care about that. I found out my manipulative abusive stepdad was coming to visit so I left and sat outside my dads for a couple hours because he wasn't in and I didn't have my keys. In the end I slept at my dads but ended up SH relapsing after 6 days just around midnight.

The only thing my dad ever bought me, my favourite guitar of all time, was dropped on the concrete path by an old friend of mine and I'm too scared to use him because of the immense disrepair it's in. It's beyond repair and I still have the image of it falling to the ground in my head and it keeps me awake at night.

A few weeks ago a few of my 'friends' (rather people I know) told the college about mine and the guy I'm close with's SH issue. They now think I'm a 'dominatrix instagator' making the guy self harm like me. One of them made a snide remark 'if you're addicted to self harm clap your hands'.

There's more but it hurts bringing stuff up this of the first and last time I'll post here because I just didn't know where else to turn. I promised the guy I wouldn't try and kill myself anymore but at this point I just think why bother. The college I'm at has threatened me with kicking me out because of my mental health so what's stopping me. I always fantasise about going to the woods and ending it but I've nothing to do it with. So here I am. Stuck in emotional purgatory for the millionth time.

Luckily he failed in his attempt. He's stable and being transported to  a psychiatric unit. My mother and grandmother are driving across country (the also live in a completely different state) to see him. 

He had absolutely NO history of depression or mental illness that anyone knew of. He is the most level-headed, intelligent person I know. And I feel like I've just been punched in the gut. In a million years, I would NEVER have thought of him doing something like this. I'm so sad he didn't come to me for help. We've always been close. I'm so angry he put our family through this.

3902,"I am going to lose my health insuranceI am a wreck. I have been seeing therapists on and off for years for depression and anxiety. I have screwed up so many times. When I finished High School I tried college and flunked out, lying to my parents about it until the situation dictated that I couldn't keep hiding it. I worked for a few years at terrible retail places and was miserable. I finally was able to go back to school. I love learning, and I'm good at school, but I have trouble focusing sometimes and the last two semesters have been really tough. I'm 25 and my birthday is in a couple weeks. I still live with my parents, who have been notihng but supportive of me. They love me and try to understand and help, but this semester I've had more trouble and I'm flunkin out of a few of my classes like I did before. I don't want to disappoint them, I'm too old to screw up all over again. They don't deserve to have to deal witth this. The biggest problem is that once I turn 26 in a couple weeks my health insurance has to come from school, but that only happens if im full time and right now because of how I screwed up I'm at 3 classes instead of the required 4 for full time. I won't have health insurance to talk to my therapists or continue my medication.

I can't tell my parents about it. They deserve the honesty, but I'm such a horrible person I can't deal with telling them. I want to escape and not have to deal with it anymore, and it is totally selfish of me. They've given me so much and I do nothing but screw up and all I can think about is wanting to escape my own failings, leaving them to feel sad after I am gone. That just makes me feel even worse.

I was doing so well until this semester, but this was my last chance and I blew it.

My closest friend is my ex and he’s very supportive in my recovery even though towards the end of our relationship I hurt him deeply and often, something I’m still remorseful about to this day.

Among those things were issues I caused within his friendship group due to me “splitting” and seeing those people as against me. I know I was wrong even though those feelings felt rational at the time but he worries I’ll never get along with them and I don’t see the point in trying to when they already dislike me. We had a huge argument about it last night because I said I didn’t regret acting on my feelings...only the fallout which isn’t true because I regret both but it’s hard for me to admit i’m wrong when I feel attacked.. 

The reason this matters is because we both had planned to be with each other again in the future but I feel like now I’ve ruined everything. 

He told me last night I haven’t changed which hurt because I feel like i’ve been doing so much better and communicating better and not acting on impulse..I just made a mistake last night.

I hate hurting the people I love and I know they will be better off without me because I’m toxic and manipulative and I don’t think I’ll ever recover. Suicide is almost an act of kindness when it comes to me...it’s like putting an animal down so it can’t hurt anyone else.

I have pills but not enough to be fatal.

People always seem to find there way around me, but I've never had an actual close relationships with any of them. Middle school was sickening. High school was torture. Couldn't get into any of the colleges or art schools I wanted to because of my failing grades due to depression and isolation. 

I saw a counselor back when I was 20 who had told me that I've been dealing with major depression for about 9-10 years and that he couldn't help me. He recommended me to get a complete physical and see a psychiatrist to get to the roots of my problems, but at the time my parents argued about it so much that nothing ever came from it.

Now that I'm older with no job, no car, no money, and no healthcare, I can only see a free counselor when I can manage to make it there, and I refuse to go back because she was video recording me and I believe she was showing it to other people even though she claims it was for her college course to become certified it made me incredibly uncomfortable.
She had me on Anti depressants and mood stabilizers. They didn't help and just made me want to sleep all day. I've tried to check myself into a clinic, but since I don't have any money, they just recommended me to a hotline and the same free counselor who I refused to go an see.

I feel as if none of my family cares. If anything they use it to guilt trip one another. That's never really changed, but at this point I feel as if I'm just being kicked around with mental health problems from one person tolerating me to the next. I've been kicked out of 2 different houses since January, soon to be 3 after my grandmother has had enough. No one is hearing what I'm saying and taking it seriously. They all say It's a cry for help and don't treat it as if I'm a threat to myself or others. I'm officially the boy who cried wolf.

I've spent the majority of my life alone, angry, resenting other people. I can't remember a time in my life where I've actually been happy or content other than when I'm alone but it seems to be getting worse and worse. Art has been my only way of coping, but I've lost a lot of passion for it since I've been transitioning into an adult. 

I've tried to kill myself twice before when I was younger, but failed at both attempts. This was back in my teens. I started cutting in Febuary of this year (2016) but (somehow) managed to keep myself from doing that, but since then, a large portion of my day is spent contemplating suicide. I'm tired of the ""it'll get better"" speeches, I'm sick of the ""just change"" talks because I've been hearing them for about a decade now with absolutely no progression and I'm still wanting to die. Recently I even find myself writing suicide notes and deleting them. I'm completely drained of this. It's literally ruined my life and if I have to look forward to another 20 years of this I KNOW I'm not going to make it.

I can't raise a kid like this. I can't have a career like this. I can't keep wanting more for myself when this is all I'm worth. I'm ready to die, but I'm terrified.",suicide
3911,"I've contemplatedso long story short I've had a really shit year and I've contemplated for the first time (21m)). sorry about the long post and weird typing. typed this while emotional mess

long story:

this year started with my father dying and he was my closest friend and confidant and my main person id always go to for help. we like I said, he died this year and being me I internalized it and didn't take it to well, my only help was my girlfriend( now ex but ill get to that). during the whole funeral situation, my family basically had a come apart and my mother wasn't invited, my family on my fathers side just acknowledged it and said shes not wanted here. now my parent were split for 11 years at that point but I did not think it was appropriate and I got into an argument with them about it and it just went to shit at the funeral none the less. well that's the first part

&amp;#x200B;

second was the fact that I lost contact with my intire family. basically my aunt(which caused the funeral ruckus) never contacted me after the funueral and so we lost contact with my dads side including gma(get to that in a minute). on my mother side I lost contact beause of my mother and her being a bitch, I mean at this point our relationship was already strained but the ruckus broke and we had a falling apart which included her intire side of the family. so basically I was left alone with my ex and her family. I couldn't stay in contact with my contact because around may she started really getting demenshia bad and she had time where she wouldn't remember me which broke my heart so I couldn't talk to her anymore without falling apart.

&amp;#x200B;

third: my emotions and goals: it wasn't until recently that I had my shit together. basically I don't really have ambition ions I kind of just drifted which included my emotions, I didn't have any really just I'm there. I'm getting better now but its taken 7 years just to get to this point now. I go from job to job and have no happiness or sadness.

&amp;#x200B;

fourth: my friends: my friends have been shit with one dropping rent on me and two taking shit care of their dogs and me having to look after them (living together) not to mention the friend I have to help me with relationship issues she just dropped me like a brink when I asked for help.

&amp;#x200B;

finally my ex/girlfriend: this was just last month but in reality has been happening for a while. we have been discussing for about a month about moving in and the problems we have so we decided wed work on them together. well obvi that didn't work and now we are broken up, mostly. we plan on attempting to get back together if we can fix the issues that are wrong with both parties and that's fair with me. the only problem is that the we went from talking all the time  to no time. I thought id be fine cause it would be me at the therapist fixing my issues but it gets worse each day and my feeling towards her get stronger and stronger. I got hit by a train were I think of her every night and every day. I'm scared and jealous that she might find a better person in our selected  time. my heart acks all day especially being at home most of the time being I work from home now. we are talking this sat about what needs to be fixed to continue the relationship. I believe that's all so far

&amp;#x200B;

it happened  twice and both were a day apart, I thought of loosing her and never being with her again and just the emotional bubble I have inside me that probably has burst. and nobody to help me through this

&amp;#x200B;

the only thing good that happened was my doggo and my therapist helping me but I seems to late

On January 2020, I had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and it's taking its toll on me. I couldn't go to therapy because of the coronavirus outbreak. Whenever me and my mother have arguments, I'm always the wrong one. She always keeps herself on top, and I couldn't take things anymore. I just want to die. Prolonging the time before we die is senseless: because we'll all die in the future anyway.

What's the point of living, really? We just get raised by our parents, then what? Compete ourselves with others using our learned skills and knowledge, and compete for the best resources available? Try to gain as much experiences, relationships, achievements, knowledge, and satisfaction, when at the end you'll just die anyway? 

Humans are worthless, selfish pieces of crap. All we ever really did was compete for resources. And they didn't even see global warming as a result of their selfish deeds, competing for resources against the other species of the animal kingdom. Not only that: Humans are well known to compete with other humans too. You have IQ and skills? You climb up the hierarchy. Acquire financial and relationship status. Gain self esteem. You don't have IQ or skills? You stay down the ladder. Live the worst life possible. None to low financial or relationship status. You gain the least esteem. All because of fucking brain and hormonal differences.  

The world is mad. We just stress ourselves out for senseless selfish deeds, when at the end we'll all just die anyway. We are just letting emotional and physical pains, insecurities, anxieties, and fears of death stay on our sides, when at the end we'll all just die anyway. 

Or should I say, we are just prolonging the time left before our final line: death. It's senseless.

3924,"My dad just physically abused me. What should I do? Ok guys, this is a long one, so please bear with me. I am really seeking some helpful information, so it would be great if you could stick through till the end.

It all started when I was lying on my bed, tired after I just finished a long science project. Since I'd sat inside all day, my mum wanted me to go out for a walk. I refused. My mum kept trying to wake me up, nudging me and eventually trying me lift me up off bed. My bed was facing the other side, so I couldn't actually see my mum. I sleepily shook my elbow to try and get her hands off me, but ACCIDENTALLY (notice the emphasis on the word 'accidentally') elbowed her in the nose. She let out a little exclamation but it was nothing serious.

I try to get up and apologise, but, next thing I know, my dad's on top me, pinning me to the bed. I was quite groggy, but nevertheless, sound quite calm when I told my father to take his hands off me. He flat-out said no, asking me why I hit mum. I tried to tell him it was an accident, but kindly told him to take his hands off me first so we could have a proper discussion. Again, he refused (by the way, he's gotten physical with me in the past, and this time I had had enough). I told him multiple more times to take his hand off me, and after even more refusals from his end, I snapped. I started screaming ""HELP ME! AAAAAAARGH!"" and tried to wrestle out of his control. I finally broke free and bolted to the corridor, screaming my lungs out. He followed. - quick little side note: he's my stepdad. not my biological father.

The next few scenes were a bit of a blur. He started physically abusing me, hitting me, and I used my self defence. My mum came out, confused as hell. She starting screaming for dad to stop, and dad pushed her aside. He kept trying to get hold of me, but I kept escaping. Finally, he started just hitting me hard. Although he's weak, I didn't want to hit him back and make the situation even worse. So I simply fell to the floor, tears streaming down my facing, calling for help. I said I would call the police. My mum spread her arms over my body, trying to protect me, but my dad shoved her aside and just didn't let go of me. That was when things got serious. He starting shouting like mad, calling me names and threatening me with some very dark exclamations. He was absolutely furious; I can't even think of a word to describe how angry he was. 

He kept trying to get to me as well as shouting at the top of his voice (verbal abuse). Finally, he let go (I guess he got tired; he isn't that fit). He said that neither he nor my mum would talk to me unless I wrote them both a ""written"" apology. He said I could't go anywhere except for school (btw, I play tennis, guitar, and meet with friends sometimes). He continued with the threatening remarks; one of them I can remember is that if I ever tried to defend myself again, ""he'd bash me to a pulp my tennis racquet"". It was actually a very traumatising experience.

Now, my fellow teens, I ask you this: what next? Do I call the police? One thing I forgot to mention was that when I told him that I would call the police, he wanted me to. He waved the phone in my face, telling me to dial 000 (the Australian police number). Why did he do that? I know that even if I call the police, they won't do anything. Unfortunately, I have zero evidence whatsoever. The only witnesses are my family members, who don't really count in the case of a legal situation. And to top it all off, my dad is a very good liar. Should I just call the kid's helpline instead? Or...? Does anyone have any solutions whatsoever? Why is my dad even like this???? Please answer, I'm really quite emotionally scarred.

As a child I was emotionally abused by both my parents. My dad can only understand money and sports. I didn't like sports, nor was I very good at them, but he made me play them all (not exaggerating) which created a cycle of disappointment, humiliation, and emasculation.

My mother has some undiagnosed personality disorder. She spent most of my childhood either crying, having imaginary fights with me when I'd be in an entirely different part of the house, and making me take her medication because she said I was the reason she was so sad.

I got into a good college in 2007, and then the financial crash of 2008 happened. Intellectually unqualified for any field of study with job security, I studied English Lit, got through college smoking myself into isolation and barely crawling out with zero distinction or careee goals. 

Upon graduating, I moved back home. My dad, always one to shove square pegs into round holes, said I had to work for him and got me a job selling insurance in my hometown while everyone I knew fro college moved to Brooklyn or Los Angeles to intern at some prestige bullshit, or stay in the womb of academia and get masters or their ph.d.

It was during this time that my mom decided to become an alcoholic. This was enough, and so I just moved about 5 hours away from my family to temporarily live with my sister who git me a job, but who's, understandably, put some limits on the time I can live with her.

I'm consumed with anger, regret, and isolation. Quitting pot means I'm fighting a long, lonely, mindfuck battle that absolutely nobody gives a fuck about. I've wasted every opportunity I've had and spend my time reading classic literature, playing chess, or watching TV - in other words, still avoiding figuring out how to make something of my life.

I was raised Catholic, left the church, but still remain sympathetic to the concept of Agape. I don't know if many of you read, but I cried for hours over Joyce's Ulysses, which, despite its many difficulties, is simply about thus Love for others despite all of life's injustices.

Well, even with all that, I am consumed by loathing (both for myself and for what's going on in my country right now *guess which country*) 

I feel completely useless and want to leave. Even the genius of a book like Joyce's Ulysses can't persuade me to stick around. My mother has begun sending me drunk texts filled with misspelt apologies, but I've finally blocked them. My dad and I have an OK relationship, but it's still one defined by tragic misunderstanding, and with years of recovery from drug abuse ahead of me, it just seems like too much. I don't foresee marriage. I don't foresee career fulfillment.

I do love him and I know he cares about me but he also has a really bad temper. He doesn’t believe in therapy.

And then he screamed at me until I cried (because him screaming at me is very traumatic and reminds me of the really bad times during the divorce), and then screamed at me because I was crying, all the while telling me the things he always tells me.

3944,"my friend hanged himself Hello Reddit

Yesterday I received a message from someone claiming to be the brother (let's call him Daniel) of an old friend of mine (and call him Robert). He messaged me using Robert's discord account so I had no clue if it really was his brother. Daniel started asking me questions about me and the relationship I had with Robert. We were only friends and nothing more. We haven't talked in a year because last time we did, we had a pretty big fight since he couldn't accept the fact that I found myself a boyfriend. Robert was drunk and never talked to me ever again. Long story short, Daniel ended up telling me Robert hanged himself in his appartment last year, but was found two weeks ago. Now this is where things start to be weird, because if a body is hanging and left alone for a year at room temperature, he should be in an advanced decomposition state. Anyway, Daniel also told me about a letter Robert wrote for me and now I'm waiting for him to send it.

The thing is, I'm not sure I can believe Daniel. I knew Robert had a thing for me, but he never told me about having a brother, I think he is lying but isn't faking a suicide a bit over the top ? In the messages I received, there were many incoherent things. For example, Daniel asked me if I was Robert's ex-girlfriend, but only asked me later if I was a boy or a girl. If Robert was dead last year, wouldn't his neighbors start smelling the corpse ? Wouldn't his employer phone him ? Wouldn't his dog bark at his owner ? I tried calling him on his phone and it rang, which means it's not out of service. I'm asking myself so many questions and I'm not sure what to do, this is a very weird situation I never had to deal with before.

It was a bad divorce and I remember my aunt saying she wanted to strangle my mom to my mom while I was there. I wasn't allowed to tell my dad anything about her house because then we were told we wouldn't get to see our mom again. She also was trying to turn us against him and she understood my depression when I was a child although I never got help until later. She liked me so I believed her about my dad. But she also became an alcoholic and I had to pay for dinner sometimes with my christmas and birthday money and had to drive her home one time about an hour alone when I was 15 because she brought wine with her and passed out. We were there with my stepdad and siblings but we took two cars and I was the one who stepped up. Then I told our stepdad that I wanted her to start drinking less because she always got mad and then passed out on the couch and he told her that and she kicked him out. Then she got worse and My brother and I chose to move out and move in with our dad full time instead of 50/50. This was when I was 16 and she died while I was 17 two weeks before senior year of high school. I think she might have killed herself because no one will tell me how she died and I found out years later that she was bipolar. I had been treated for depression when I was a junior but I wasn't allowed medication because of my dad saying no. Her death didn't really hit me until college and when it did my depression worsened and I became suicidal for the first time. I found help at my colleges counseling center and began to realize a lot was wrong. I thought everything that happened to me was normal because thats how my family looks at it they pretend nothing ever happened and that everything is good. At this point I was 18 and had to drop some classes because I wasn't functioning properly and was going to fail the classes. My dad found out and burst into my room while I was sleeping and yelled at me and questioned me for about a half hour and then he ignored me for about 6 months. My Aunt made me talk to him and he blamed me for everything wrong with me. Around this time I tried to kill myself after he had me clean his girlfriends car and I was crying because I was out of energy because of my depression and then had to clean her car and he saw me crying but left anyway and I had done my research and knew it would take about 12 minutes in the garage with the engine on but I only made it to 7 before chickening out and I cried in my room until passing out. Shortly after I had to change therapists and was barely holding everything together with work and a partial class load and the school racing team I was on. I felt terrible around my family so I was only home for about 4 hours a night which eventually broke me. My dad still was mostly ignoring me and refused to get brakes for my car because ""money was tight"" even though he said he would pay for a car and maintain it but wouldn't pay for tuition. He was going on trips with his girlfriend though. I had some close calls with the car and knew he didn't care about my safety as much as he did money. Then my sophomore year of college I finally got medication after working through that with my therapist and I discovered that my something wasn't right with my dad and family. I learned that he is probably an undiagnosed narcissist and I set down the road of trying to accept it and the fact that he would never be a real parent to me. Which has been very hard and I still sometimes think it must be something I've done and that I'm not good enough to be liked or loved and that I'm a bad person who doesn't deserve love, kindness or happiness. That I don't deserve to live and that I should just give into the pain inside because I'll never deserve to be happy and that no one will ever really love me but that it's all a trick to manipulate me into doing what they want. I just feel like poison inside and my world has turned upside down and I don't know what to believe anymore and I feel so damaged and broken beyond repair that there's no point because even when I think I deserve better I'll probably never heal enough and I'll feel like this forever. My Aunt also recently told me that no one will be nice to me or like me because I'm too quiet and negative and that they won't until I go back to being the happy kid. Sorry I know it's probably too depressing and not that bad in real life but worse in my head.

ive struggled with depression and social anxiety all my life. i am 26 years old and i live with my parents, and am currently unemployed, although i have worked in the past. i recently applied and was accepted to college. the plan currently stands that i am going to rent a very small apartment with my friend. this would be the first time i have lived away from home

i dont have a lot of money and i heard through a mutual friend that my future roomate is worried i wont be able to afford the rent due to my work history. this is a valid concern, seeing as all the jobs i have had i have quit (3)

the thing that terrifies me is that all of the jobs that i have experience in make me absolutely miserable, and the prospect of working a job AND attending classes at college seems as if it would break me

i dont know if the financial aid i will be granted will be enough. i dont know if i am making the right choice in even going to college. i dont know if moving in with my friend will be a mistake. i dont know how i am going to survive if the only jobs that people will hire me for make me suicidal

im just scared. im trying to be brave. i know im 26 and an 'adult' but i feel so far behind everyone else. life isnt a race and i try not to compare myself to others, but still. there are so many people around me who make me feel like a failure because im not employed or think say im lazy

I've been feeling horrible nowadays... But first some context: I'm a 17yo NB mexican... I just feel like random ""depressive attacks"" (idk if that even exists) passes through me from time to time, I'm currently in one of those —and the strongest I've ever had... I've never had the intense necessity to self-harm, but now I... I just feel like ripping my veins out—. 
Well, you be probably thinking why do I feel like that... Thing is I don't even know... I mean, I have such severe things going on, but they've been there for quite a long period of time, and never lead to anything close to this.

They rejected me from both my dream careers (Neuroscience and Genomics —but still accepted in other 3—) like 2 weeks ago, but i don't think that's the problem, or at least not the whole.
Those attacks I said usually are coined together with flashbacks —long history—, shortened version: I think I was raped around 5-7yro and I had amnesia (those flashbacks came to my mind since idk when, but long ago, but I instantly forgot about it like next day... Until 1 year ago when suddenly I got conscious about having a mental gap [however I still can't remember anything about what happened, I just know something happened].

So, the other thing is being trans... I just accepted it during this quarantine, and no close-relative knows. I'm quite anxious about it (back in time, I thought trans ppl exaggerated dysphoria, now I see it's fucking completely real), whatever, I don't thing that's what's affecting me this much rn neither.

Idk if I just had panick attacks the whole night or what, but my hands' sweating, I got random crying attacks, hyperventilation, my hearth goes crazy, and I can't fucking sleep (as a matter of fact, can't since like 1 week ago).

I tried to ask for help to my friends, but I feel like I'm bothering 'em. I first had this today around 12 in the night, and a girl started chatting with me out of nothing, so that tranquilized me for a while, but then another attack came 30 mins later and went off, but then another one came, and one more like 20 mins ago (I'm at 3:50 in the morning).",suicide

******************************



My life has taken many turns up until now. Not the worst you've seen on this sub. Sexual abuse dominated almost my entire high school life. I was afraid of sleep, as hyper realistic nightmares filled my sleep. I was threatened daily with torture and rape. I developed insomnia, depression, and psychosis. I was threatened with being kicked onto the streets if I didn't do whatever he asked of me. Once I got away from him, I was fine for a while. I was still depressed most of the time, but now I had little fits of manic energy, so I brushed it off. I graduated high school thinking it was all over. But then the dreams came back. My psychosis caused me to self harm daily, and I also developed an eating disorder. I attempted suicide for the first time this February. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2. I went to the psych ward multiple times after this, and in May, I attempted again. 

I've tried recovery, I really have. I wanted so desperately to be better, to be happy. But some people can never reach happiness. Some people just keep going down. I am all alone. All my friends have abandoned me, I'm just a drag to them, even my friend that I went too for everything told me they couldn't help me anymore. I have no one left to talk to. I have only one friend who will still talk to me, but I can tell I'm being a burden. No one can understand. In the end, everyone always leaves me. I won't go back to the psych ward. I'd rather be dead. Last time I went I was treated like a prisoner, had my rights taken away. I got even worse because of being there. 

I feel so alone. All around me are smiling faces, telling me I can recover. But they don't know that. They can't possibly understand. I'm done. I've put on my favourite movie, got my razor out...its showtime",suicide

3974,"“You don’t owe anybody success”
In America (and elsewhere I’m sure), the ferocity of competition is incredibly damaging to the soul. We blame ourselves for not becoming rockstars or billionaires because we’re told “anyone can do it!” and it’s horribly untrue and destructive. 
Capitalism has done great things, but at the expense of our humanity. So motherFUCK anybody who passes judgement on you for not becoming what they think success looks like. 

On this sub I see heart-wrenching stories of absolute terror...horrors that are so foreign to me. But also some that are not, such as the feeling of utter insignificance. There are well-hidden realms of hell in this world that masquerade as innocuous and even pleasant and so when we start tearing ourselves down despite no true wrongdoing (murder, rape)...we would be wise to realize that it is only a product of our brainwashing, and that we are perfect exactly where we are. This isn’t hippie-talk...this is the truth. 

Of course, working to better your surroundings is a totally cool goal...but don’t attach your self-worth to it. You are not worth only what you can produce. Your life is immensely valuable all on its own. Think back to when you were a kid. Were you upset because you weren’t a prodigy like Mozart? So then why do we set such high standards as we age?

3980,"A LESSON IN FINANCES As a teenager, my parents took the liberty of teaching me the best way to go about finances. While you all are still young, this is the perfect time to start working on finances and becoming successful in the future.

Lesson 1: Relationships
Relationships are key in finances. If your future spouse doesn’t agree with how you want to live, it may be time to consider someone else. Most divorces happen because of finances, and people who don’t agree, and if you don’t agree with your spouse and end up in a divorce, they automatically get 50% of the money you have, and if you’re a male, you have to pay child support and you won’t be able to live how you want, because you won’t have money. Now, sometimes, you can compromise with your girlfriend, but make sure it happens before marriage. That’s the cutoff that you have.

Lesson 2: Investing
A lot of you will be starting your jobs real soon here. Talk to your parents about starting a stocks account for you. Investing is an amazing way to earn money for the future. If you want to learn a bit more about this, there are all kinds of Youtubers and YouTube videos that explain it all. This is one of the best ways to get money and set yourself up for the future and paying for those things you want. I have met too many people who didn’t learn about this until their 30’s and 40’s and they regretted it very deeply. Invest in the stocks, remember, this is the time to buy while everything is down from COVID-19.

Lesson 3: Student Loans
DO NOT GET STUDENT LOANS!!! Student loans are a HORRIBLE idea. They seem great at first, but you become a slave to them if you don’t pay them off immediately. The longer you wait, the more expensive they are, and the worse life will be for you. Do not get student loans. One way to avoid that is investing like I said earlier. Make sure to set aside money to invest and you will be able to pay for schooling in the future.

Lesson 4: Your future life
In the future after college, make sure to set aside some money for investments. The best way to go about this is saving $150 a month for your investment purposes, and put it into your stocks account. At first, it may be hard, but it will set you up for life, and by doing this, you can become a successful person.

Lesson 5: School
Make sure to do well in school. Doing well in school is one of the key components in being successful. You don’t even have to do super good, just try to avoid C’s, and 100% avoid D’s and F’s. If you can do this, future you will be thanking yourself for the work and determination you put into how you wanted to live later in life.

Lesson 6: Personal items
Sometimes, you will want to buy something nice for yourself, like a nice piece of tech or something. Do not do this. In a few years, it will be outdated and it won’t be very good anyways, so why get a new one now? Use the money you WOULD use to get that device or electronic, and invest it! A lot of the stuff I am telling you will mostly revolve around investing in the stock market, and trust me, you will be grateful in the future that you were able to learn this stuff.

Just remember, this is something that most people would regret not learning, and if you can discipline yourself now, you will be setting yourself up to be successful in the future, and you can get the things you enjoy to have. You will be able to get those cars you want, you will be able to get that nice computer, and keep updating it. Just follow these steps, and you can almost guarantee that you will be able to retire and live well.",non-suicide

I'll be making them the next few days and then mailing them to a friend, so they get to him after I'm gone. 

Then it'll just be me, the wind, the rain, the mud and the edge. 

I always made the mistake of fetishising the way I go - it had to be perfect, to be a profound escape, life isn't profound, like it's rosy, life isn't good. Why would death be. We're born into shit, we live through shit and then we die of shit. 

It's going to be scary, lonely and cold, but that will all end, and so will everything else once I'm gone. 

I fucking hate my family, my friends will be fine, my sister will be fine. 

It'll hurt my parents - who gives a fuck. Fuckers ground me down, drove me into the shit and made me wish I was dead for as long as I can remember. My prick of a dad choked me out the other day, thought it'd stop by the time I was 22 but guess not. 

It'll hurt my friends - they'll understand. Eventually it dulls and fades and you get used to it, I know from experience. 

It'll hurt my sister. That's going to suck, sure. she'll never get over it, sure. Am I really supposed to stay living in purgatory just so she can have an okay life? Fuck that, losing me won't be that much of a detriment. 
She'll find a bf or gf, get married, have kids and die like the rest of us. She'll have to deal with me being gone, sure.

I feel like I've fulfilled all I've ever known as my purpose in life and everything seems completely pointless. To boot, I'm new in town and 90% of my friends live 3+ hours away. The ones that do live nearby flake out on hanging out almost every single time. One of my best friends said she'd try to move here after she graduates but it's apparent that's not going to happen. My long distance boyfriend promised the same but I seriously doubt that will happen either. And if we can't figure out a way to be together, he's already told me that'll be the end of it.

I'm 15 years old, life is fucking bullshit, things get better? No they fucking don't.

I'm 15, dad doesn't live in the house, but that doesn't affect me, atleast I don't hear endless abuse and screaming now, that's a plus.
My mom gives around 1.5/10 shits which is really low on the shit giving scale (basically she doesn't give a fuck about how I feel).
School been going downhill ever since 9th grade when I realized I'm not into academics and just wasting my time which makes me more depressed if all is not enough.
Mom pressures me into studying which makes more anxious and depressed.
I think about suicide on hourly basis, actually that's a fucking joke... it's always on my mind not just hourly.
It's summer break now and I was supposed to work and pursue my hobby, but HAHAHA who the fuck would employ a failure, so now I can't pursue a hobby that I can enjoy when I get back to school, which makes me more depressed because I got nothing to do when school aka prison is back.


Oh but I don't have to worry... things get better, right? No that's the biggest lie I have ever been told. Things get better only when I die or get out of school which is in 2 years; impossible to survive.
There is absolutely no point in living, I wish I have a gun so I can shoot myself and be done with it.

Hey! I was just hanging out at youtube and i came across this Sal Khan TED talk. Well, Sal is the founder of Khan academy, and he pretty much said some stuff i believe is the biggest problem on education. Year after year we accumulate gaps in our learning, and at some point it all collapses. No one is born a math genius, or a great historian, but we all can learn these stuff and master it. 

I thought i could never be good at physics because it was such an messy subject, turns out i was missing some of the fundamentals, and once i learnt these basic stuff i could learn and master physics at a high school level.

4011,"If you're bored and are looking for a light read, check out this book I wrote when I was younger! Hi everyone! When I was younger (think preteen age), one of my hobbies was writing books based on what was going on in my life. Recently, I've been inspired to look back at my old writing for some reason. It's definitely not worthy of publishing, but I am curious whether it would have appealed to you when you were around the age of the protagonist (10-12). Some things I wrote in this book are extremely unrealistic while others are quite plausible even looking back at it years after I wrote it, which makes me curious how it would be received by others.

Here is a synopsis of my book: *Ten-year-old Margaret Lorie is your typical preteen girl in many ways. She's learning to navigate the transition between being a child and a young adult, which naturally involves many changes. The story opens as Meg must cope with a new addition to the family via the adoption of a little girl named Wayne. Join Meg's ups and downs as she navigates the unpredictable world of middle school friendships. You'll meet nice and mean girls during the journey, but beware - most girls around this age can be both! And, of course, as the title would suggest, Meg develops a crush on a boy named Max who is actually fourteen years old. How will their friendship develop over the course of the story and influence Meg and the world around her?* [Read Max and I to find out](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9QXF08iQtf31iGRPq29mFz51ccMdfbJWib7sXf0Tko/edit?usp=sharing)*.*",non-suicide

4024,"Right now, I feel like I’m on the brink of doing itI went to counseling yesterday to be evaluated after a long struggle with my past. There have been many triggers that made me decide to go. I’ve had a crisis back in May where I almost voluntarily admitted myself to the hospital. 

In addition, a recent breakup has been almost traumatic for me—I cry every single day when I think about it. It’s been three months, and I still cry every day. 

I also start grad school on Monday, and have been feeling impostor syndrome. I feel like I’m unqualified to be in that position. 

My 3 roommates also had an intervention with me because they’ve noticed I’ve been acting strangely and lashing out. I’ve noticed it too, so I’ve been isolating myself to avoid complications. However, they have taken my social withdrawal as an offense. During the intervention, I told them my problems (notes above) and they still seemed to invalidate what I felt. 

I’m not sure what else I have to look forward to for the future. I have been depressed for more than half of my life now.  When the crisis counselor asked me what my ‘baseline’ was, I couldn’t tell him because I’ve been depressed for so long.

 So I plan to leave it when I'm old enough to go and live out on my own. But I dont want to be lonely, I would never be able to talk to my family ever again practically. And if they were to try and reach out to me then they could get in trouble to. So I have 3 choices with my life. 
1, either I stay and just suffer my whole life having to deal with this religion until my parents were to die. 
2, leave the religion and my family as soon as I can have my own living arrangements and a steady job setup and have to put up with never being able to tall to my family ever again.
3, just killing myself would be the easiest way out. I've already done so many stupid things throughout my life and my parents can already tell I'm not doing that good in this religion. So if I were to end it all I wouldnt have to deal with either being with any family at all or dealing with this religion still.

4042,"Warning: Suicide (Nobody will read this)My name is William and I am 23 years old. I have a mental illness. I suffer from depression, I have anxiety and I was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. What lead to me to this point of suicide is loliness overall. I see and feel the loliness I suffer everyday. I have no support system and have been battling it all on my own through restless nights and empty days. I attempt to go out in public and can see that people don't wanna be near me. They look at me like I'm some kind of animal. That's why I have this alternative to take the time and tell you my story here online. The things I feel to some might be confusing and disturbing to some people which is understandable. Some people say they may care about me when I feel the exact opposite and they more, or less resent me more than anything. I have had experiences where I have voluntarily admitted myself for psychiatric help and got nothing out of it, but the mistreatment of the staff. I have called the National Suicide Prevention lifeline services and was told on numerous occasions believe or not to ""hang up"" because I was only emotionally distraught instead of being actively suicidal in that moment with only the thoughts of suicide building through my mind before and after those experiences. Between my past traumatic history and current life has left me depressed with the thoughts of unworthiness, uselessness, unwilling, and now suicidal. I get angry, sad and cry to myself, and  then the feelings repeat itself in a vicious cycle. I feel the urge to self harm a lot and use weapons and leverage on myself to put myself in complete danger. When I'm around good people that want to help and for example I get a negative attitude because I'm going through so much and feel overwhelmed. I tend to violently snap and perform violent activities on myself and possibly others if physically someone was around which I know I'm more than capable of hurting and possibly killing someone. I've been exposed to a lot of fucked up shit. I couldn't handle it alone and till this day I feel alone even though someone out there might be experiencing pain of their own, but as a victim to society, as a vicitim of my own I don't see that because I'm caught up in my own problems and imprisoned by my mind. I am not a very socialized individual and my actions speak for me. As I said I don't have the support and I have no family, or friends. Unfortunately I've had more bad luck than good where people don't want to acknowledge my existence as a human being first and look at me and even mistreat me like a cancer to society. At 23 years of age I've pretty much experienced it all since the beginning of my childhood. I'm not gonna write about all my past traumatic experiences only for the simple fact is I'm feeling anxious at this very moment. I've been through the heart aches, I've been apart of violence and devolped an explosive and destructive temper because of it and violent tendencies whenever I feel lonely and sad. At least I acknowledge I have been through enough where you would think some kinda high ups or ""anarchy"" is watching me to know enough I've been through enough and paid it with my heart and soul.  Moments where I was in life threatening situations to being in what is known as a life threatening situation, but by my own device. I have health issues. I've had injuries caused by certain events that transpired in my youth. I'll give you an example: Whenever I get anxious like I have been, and my anxiety shoots up, I get like a shock wave in my legs, my jaw sometimes feels wired shut, my arms start to shake, or sometimes if it gets really bad, I throw up and cough up blood in my lungs. As far as those restless nights? I go to sleep for the most part with something always on my mind that's occurimg. It's most likely a flashback of a traumatic event I went through and I toss and turn and wake up all alone with cold sweats and I sometimes scream and breathe heavy. Normally I would use Reddit as my last cry for help, but in my experience between the real world and online as far as getting and receiving emotional support had been a bust. I have had more assholes and judgmental people if anything. I think it's because people just don't want to deal with the burden of me.

Now I’m back with my parents since October. For the third time. I’ve been through several relationships that have went down hill and have caused me trauma. Now I’m with a guy who is genuinely a good guy, I do love him but he has mental issues of his own and all my issues are weighing him down. I have physical health issues on top of depression, anxiety and ptsd. I can’t hold a job, I keep trying and failing. If it’s not my Health acting up, it’s my anxiety or depression that’s so bad I can’t even bring my self to leave my bed. That’s not what I want. I’m thinking of trying for disability but I feel like I’m just making excuses and don’t deserve it. I just lost my job after 3 weeks of having it and 3 months of finding it. I told my boyfriend they fired me for being a liability (which has happened in the past) but the truth is I walked out after having a bad situation with my health and getting sick at work. I felt embarrassed and felt like they were gonna fire me anyways. I know I should of stuck it out. But I didn’t. 
I was about to move in with him, things were about to get good. My parents don’t even know I lost my job.
They think I was going to move out this weekend but my boyfriend told me he wants me to prove I can hold a job because he’s in no position to take Care of me, he can not mentally handle it. He told me he’s not happy and his anxiety is sky high because of all the pressure he’s under. He told me he does love me and wants this to work but he feels like I’m not trying. 
The thing is I can’t tell if I’m trying or not. Some days I feel like I am then others I can’t make proper adult decisions because I’d rather just lay in bed and pretend not to exist.

4089,"Messed up beyond repair.I don't even know how to start this.
In November I quit my delivery job, I wrecked two cars, and couldn't handle the stress and anxiety of working inside a pizza store. My mood has progressively gotten worse. I thought I would be able to buy a car with my tax return, I worked 5 jobs last year, I made close to 8k. I got my hopes too high. I'm not even getting enough to cover tuition for one class at the community college.

I've always been depressed, since I was maybe 6 or 7. I've been on and off of meds my whole life. I'm 21 now. I was expelled from high school my freshman year for buying drugs and trying to kill myself during school hours. I had a kid when I was 17 because the boy I was dating raped and abused me, I couldn't abort, because I genuinely thought if he didn't kill me himswlf, he would find someone else to do it. He went to prison for trying to bomb his school. I failed my first semester of college, because I couldn't keep up with the class work and having a new born. I tried to get a job, but I couldn't keep one, either juggling child care and job hours or the anxiety of interacting with other people. Then I tried to go to college again last year, and another abusive person I was dating kept me from going to my classes. He told me I wasn't allowed to be there while he was there, and so I dropped out. A friend helped me get my delivery job, things were ok for a month or two, and my boss at that job, started being more blatantly abusive to the workers, singling me and a few others out. I freaked out and tried to jump off a bridge the hospital stay put me 6k in debt. In total, I've been hospitalized 6 times, and I've tried to kill myself over 10.
Nothing seems to get better, every time I try to do something to fix my situation, it backfires and makes everything worse. I don't even see a point in trying anymore. I can't take care of myself, my family resents me. I've messed up my life so badly, that there's really no way to get out of the hole.

The past few months I've been away for school in which ive made some great friends who helped me get through a couple bad panic attacks but i cant get it out of my head that all im doing is ruining our friendship because of my issues. I used to never consider ending it because of my problems but my mind keeps going in that direction lately. Im still pretty sure i wouldn't end my life despite my thoughts because i dont want to put my friends or family through that but im really worried.

I have terrible crippling social anxiety I can't go anywhere I almost broke down last week because I had to go buy some fucking food.

I'm so tired of being told to ""hang in there!"" If you took one step into my disgusting mind you would be begging to get out, I have suicidal homicidal and compulsive tendencies I'm pretty sure I've been hallucinating for about a year now and I go into dissociative type moods where it feels like someone else is in my mind.

I'm on my 3rd shitty therapist who is going no better then the last ""have you tried grounding? Here I'll teach you some techniques"" I want to kill you.

To whoever reads this go ahead leave your petty small comment telling me it's worth it I don't care no one can convince me your words are mere raindrops to be wiped away in my mind.

I guess I came here because I don't want to feel lonely I've had vivid inescapable daydreams of my family hanging themselves as I kill myself over and over and over again get out of my head.

This isn't normal I'm not normal maybe I should give in maybe I should just crumble under my compulsive mind that rewards me for shameful actions. I'm a gross disgusting being no one knows I'm like this, in fact no one is close to me I can't stand social interaction from the way people piss me off to my intrusive thoughts I'm losing the battle to spurring to being on the verge of a panic attack because social interaction is too much.

I can never say what I want to, I told my closest friend to kill themself, told my father I would rip his throat out in his sleep, I told my mother she is better off dead because she is a cripple, I look like barbed wire was grinded down my legs because I constantly cut while in some form of mania, I'm so lost I don't even shower or brush my teeth and only eat when the pain gets to me, I've lost about 20 pounds at a rapid pace, I used to masterbait all the time but that brings me nothing now I simply sit in bed even writing this has me exhausted, and I swear to god if my teacher assigns one more assignment I'm going to write a code to send him a picture of my dead body with a note that says ""you did it""

I've tried to practice religion but it didn't work for me, the way I see it people latch to religion for selfish reasons, they either tell themselves that there is an afterlife and reinforce the idea with thousands of others, or use it to overcome addiction maybe they were born into it?

My parents are constantly screaming at each other as I fall deeper into a state of delusions, MY MIND IS BUILDING IT'S OWN WORLD I am constantly in a state of hearing or seeing things and sometimes I hear people say things they didn't such case with my parents my mother asked me to get out of bed apparently but I heard vivid and clear ""your almost 18 get ahold of yourself""

4098,"I think I might try to overdose again...Last month I tried ODing on my meds, but didn't have nearly enough left and just ended up getting high. I'll finally be able to get refills on the 12th, and I'm thinking about attempting it again, possibly adding alcohol this time if I can get my hands on some to ensure I don't survive.

I'm just tired of being a fuck up, a burden, a disappointment, a failure, a worthless mentally ill piece of shit who just pushes people away. I recently pushed away the girl of my dreams, who I loved (and still love) more than anything in this world. I wish I had been a better boyfriend, I wish I hadn't been so codependent, impatient, negative. She just wanted me to be her happy escape from all of the bs in her life, and I failed her.

I'm really considering attempting suicide again once I get my refills. I hate this endless cycle of me opening up and getting closer to people and just becoming a burden and pushing them away eventually. I loved my girl more than life itself, I cared about her more than I've ever cared about anyone or anything, and now she won't even talk to me... and it's all my fault. She gave me plenty of chances, and I just kept making the same mistakes. 

I'm tired of being alone. I spent more than my fair share of time alone and miserable before I met her, and it hurts so much more now because I had my dream girl and of course I fucked it up in spectacular fashion... I don't want to be alone again, and I just seem to push away any friends I manage to make or anyone I get close to. I'm tired of this endless cycle... and to top it all off, pretty much everything about me is pathetic. I'm 20 years old with pretty much no life, and little to no life skills. Hell, I'm still trying to figure out what my ex even saw in me in the first place.

I'm almost done with this awful STEM degree that will open up so many doors to me, and that should excite me, to see some change. To be able to walk around on my own feet and see things I've never seen, to be able to give back to all of those who I owe everything.

Instead the only thing I feel is ennui. I don't care about software. I used to have passion. It's all gone. I have nothing to look forward to. I can't even bring myself to fake a little enthusiasm when my parents call to check on me.

I still don't have a plan, but sometimes I think about how miserable and average I am and can't keep from crying. To be released from all of this would be so nice. It just doesn't feel like I'll ever be happy again. I just want to send out a final message thanking everyone and go to sleep for the last time.

It's supposed to get better... but it isn't. I'm still waiting. Something will happen now and then that seems like it will lead to happiness, but thus far it's all been nothing but frigid disappointment. To protect myself from more hurt, I find myself assuming that it will be.

4104,"Thoughts. No direction.I don’t know how I’d do it. I tried to once with pills but I was so naive, I didn’t know how much was a lethal dose and took too little. Four and half days in the looney bin. Wasn’t a bad experience. Actually I learned how to be pretty happy while I was there. Only lasted a few months once I got out. I had been resisting doing it because of how bad it would hurt those I care about, but, as selfish as it is, even that wasn’t enough to hold me back anymore. I’m still sorry tho. Now, I’ve only kept myself from doing it because I feel like I can’t leave without giving something to the world first. Something people can find comfort in and use as motivation to get their own help. It seems hypocritical, yet still correct. Maybe not correct. I don’t know for sure. I don’t know anything for sure. I can’t tell when I love someone anymore. I can’t even tell if all of this stuff is legitimate. Most of the time it feels like I should shut up and get over it. The people I care about need help still, and I don’t know anyone who’ll be there for them other than me. But, slowly, they’re growing and learning. They’re becoming so independent and learning to help themselves. I thought I’d be jealous but I’m just so happy that I get to see it. The more happy about it I get, tho, the worse I feel for wanting to leave. I’ll be abandoning them. Makes me think about this “masterpiece” I wanted to make to help others. Maybe it’s not really about that. Maybe I just want to make that so I can feel like I’ve compensated for the pain I’ll be bringing those I love. Either way, I know I can’t go on. I don’t mean to be vague, but I’ve fucked everything up. If any of you care enough to know more I’ll discuss things, but this is already running long. I don’t say that to pull the whole “no one cares about me” card, I just wouldn’t really expect you to care. No ones responsibility but mine.

I had to email my geology professor last night because this week I started having trouble finding all my assignments. This morning she emails me back saying that the reason I don't have my stuff is cuz I didn't do an exam that was due *last Sunday the 13th.*

""***Excuse me? What the hell did you just say?""*** 

An exam. I missed an exam. How the fuck am I just gonna not take an exam that I have a whole week to take. I'm pretty dumb, but I'm not that dumb. You can't make up exams.

Sorry that you missed it."" **Bitch. I'm fucking mad.** 

Every single day I click through my classes, every single tab, to make sure that I'm not missing anything. I'm all caught up on my stuff, I check my grades, everything is fine, except I feel like I'm not doing enough work this week for geology. After she gave me my other assignment when I emailed her, the stupid exam popped up in my grades with a 0. ***MY GRADE WENT FROM A 102 TO A DAMN 80.*** I was pretty proud of my grade, happy that I'm not failing, trying to maintain my A's. But what the actual fuck. *How the fuck is she just gonna say ""sorry, it was there"" and give me a 0 when I know damn well it was never fucking there. At all. Ever. And it still isn't there. Anywhere. Nowhere in sight.*
